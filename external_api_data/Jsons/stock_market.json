Minister of Foreign Affairs Robert Dussey said 15 attacks in northern Togo had been perpetrated so far this year by Jama'a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM), an insurgent group in West Africa's Sahel region. He put the civilian death toll at 54. aAdsList.push('Article'); aAdsListSize.push([300, 250]); aAdsListCA.push(null); Togo has seen a rise in jihadist activity in recent years, as groups linked to Islamic State and al Qaeda have spread from the Sahel. A surge in attacks in May and June marked one of the deadliest periods in the Sahel's recent history, underscoring the threat posed by jihadist groups at a time when regional governments are estranged from former Western military allies, analysts say. Violence in the region south of the Sahara started when jihadist groups hijacked a Tuareg rebellion in the north of Mali in 2012. Groups linked to Al Qaeda and Islamic State have since seized territory despite costly military efforts to push them back, spreading into Burkina Faso and Niger and more recently into the north of coastal countries such as Togo. Thousands have been killed and millions displaced by the fighting. Dussey told Reuters that there are about 8,000 Togolese forces in the north between Togo and neighboring Burkina Faso. Analysts say JNIM has been ramping up attacks in Burkina Faso. Dussey said Togo's cooperation with Burkina Faso was very good, and said that Togo acts as a bridge between the Economic Community of West African States, of which it is a member, and the Confederation of Sahel States, consisting of military-ruled Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger.

We urge you to prioritize face-to-face negotiations with the bargaining unit and to lean into difficult conversations with the workers who are the backbone of a company as important to our economy and communities as Republic Services.\" Peabody Mayor Ted Bettencourt said in a message to the community on Monday afternoon that the last negotiating session between the sanitation workers' union and the company occurred back on July 18. \"There are continued reports of late pickups, so please expect a one- to two-day delay,\" Bettencourt said. \"We are concerned about the lack of scheduled negotiation sessions, and we strongly urge you to return to the bargaining table in good faith and without delay, to negotiate a contract that reflects the dignity of this work, one that ensures fair pay, quality benefits, and a safe workplace,\" said the delegation, which includes U.S. Reps. Jake Auchincloss, Katherine Clark, William Keating, Jim McGovern, Stephen Lynch, Seth Moulton, Richard Neal, Ayanna Pressley and Lori Trahan.\"Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\" In Beverly, residents were told to expect pickup on regular collection days, but that \"we are aware that Republic keeps missing streets.\" \"We are working to get Republic to restart recycling as soon as possible,\" Beverly officials said. In Ipswich, where some recycling routes had recently resumed, residents were told that recycling would once again be suspended this week. Danvers officials said that the town's recycling dropoff events will continue this week \"as we assess how curbside collection progresses.\" \"We are in regular communication with other communities where recycling collection has resumed, and they are reporting inconsistent or sporadic service,\" Danvers officials said. \"We anticipate a similar experience in Danvers and ask for your continued patience and understanding as service is gradually restored.\" Teamsters were back on the picket lines on Monday in Peabody, Revere, Holbrook, Roxbury and Quincy as they said they are seeking better pay, time off and health insurance improvements. Local Union 25 said there were 450 workers picketing across the country as of Monday. Officials from six North Shore and Greater Boston cities and towns were in Salem Superior Court last week to press their case for health violation citations and additional resources from Republic Services amid the strike. Beverly, Malden, Gloucester, Peabody, Danvers and Canton officials filed the complaint for injunctive relief to abate the public health nuisance resulting from what the communities called \"Republic's failure to adequately collect and dispose of trash and recycling in our communities.\" (Scott Souza is a Patch field editor covering Beverly, Danvers, Marblehead, Peabody, Salem and Swampscott.

It was the Fourth of July, and Apuzzo, an elite water polo player, was inside the water with some friends. At some point, he dove into what he thought was a drop-off, according to his mother. That's when the teen struck his head against the ocean floor. He floated back up to the water face down and unable to move. His friends thought he was playing a joke on them. But soon, they realized Apuzzo was really hurt and got him out. \"We were so fortunate that there were kids around him,\" Jackie told Patch. \"If it wasn't for his friends and the fast response from the lifeguards, he would've drowned.\" Apuzzo was taken to Long Beach Memorial Hospital, where, for hours, doctors ran tests and X-rays on him in the emergency room trauma unit, Jackie said. In the end, they found he had fractured his spine in three places. The diving accident left Apuzzo with limited mobility, and he is currently bedbound, according to his mother. He can move his upper body, but he has no finger strength or grip. He has movement in his right leg only and can't walk. \"Everyone's saying because of his age, because of his physical condition going into this, he has a strong chance of recovery,\" Jackie said. It's just a matter of time of letting the spinal chord recover.\" The 14-year-old is a star water polo player and was one of four eighth graders last year to be accepted into the 6-8 water polo academy. At the academy, he was competing at a national level, often against kids older than him, his mother said. He was getting ready to start his freshman year at Wilson High School and had been training with the water polo team before the accident. Still, Jackie said, Apuzzo is more determined than ever to make a full recovery and one day return to playing the sport he loves. \"He is a warrior,\" Jackie said. \"He's got the most positive attitude \u2014 friendly, great sense of humor, very positive. He's pushing himself to do his best.\" He's currently hospitalized at Miller Children's and Women's Hospital in Long Beach, where he goes through rehab exercises every day, including stretching and electrical muscle stimulation in his forearms. It's not yet clear how long the recovery process will last or if Apuzzo will regain full mobility, but Jackie remains hopeful. The next several months will include intensive physical therapy for Apuzzo. Luckily, Jackie said, her son has received a lot of care and support from friends and hospital staff, who have been motivating him each day to keep pushing and getting stronger. In the end, she just wants to see her son walk again and enjoy all the activities he was fond of, including fishing and surfing, Jackie said. \"It's really tough,\" Jackie said. \"But I think he's tougher.\" A fundraiser has been started to help Apuzzo's family give him the support he needs on his recovery journey.

Pusser's Landing, known for its Painkiller rum cocktails, cut the ribbon on July 21 at Canton's Lighthouse Point Marina. Located at 2780 Lighthouse Point E, Pusser's filled the vacancy left by Drift Bar. Then known as Pusser's Caribbean Grille, the laid-back eatery shuttered last Halloween after 30 years in downtown Annapolis. The old Pusser's is being replaced with two higher-end establishments. Pusser's vowed to return and searched for other waterfront locations nearby. Weeks before closing, Pusser's announced that it would move to Baltimore. Patch later reported that two longtime employees of Pusser's Caribbean Grille bought the iconic pub from its retiring ownership group for an undisclosed price. Related: 'Iconic' Dock Bar Sold To 2 Employees, New Owners Have Big Plans For MD Move New co-owners Chris Townsend and Jim Lepley plan to maintain the brand's nautical vibe. Townsend, nicknamed CT, was the general manager of Pusser's Annapolis. Lepley was a former 10-year employee of the bar. \"It's bittersweet,\" Townsend told Patch in an interview last year. \"It was a lot to take in ... but we're super excited about the opportunity to leave our mark on the brand and continue the legacy of Pusser's as we move to Baltimore.\" The new space features a floating dock bar. Inside, the year-round dining room is themed after the British Virgin Islands, where Pusser's was founded 46 years ago. Customers will still be able to sip Painkiller cocktails made from Pusser's-branded rum, and they will find a few relics from the Annapolis pub. \"We are actually moving the inside bar from the Annapolis location that was custom-built in Wales in the late '80s and early '90s,\" Townsend said. The mirrors from behind the bar also made the trip to Charm City. Boating will remain a pillar of the Pusser's identity. About a third of the marina's slips are for transient, visiting mariners. At the floating bar, there will be another 10 to 15 slips reserved for Pusser's patrons. \"We'll actually have way more opportunities for boats to come dock and dine and things like that than we had in Annapolis,\" Townsend said. \"We're really just a boat ride away from the location that we had in Annapolis.\" The new lease is for 10 years plus three separate five-year options. \"I have every confidence that they [will] do a phenomenal job,\" Clyde Culp III, retiring Pusser's Annapolis co-owner, told Patch last year. Construction was slated to begin in January. Canton-based JP2 Architects led the design. JP2 is known for its work on the Merriweather District in Columbia and Foundry Row in Owings Mills. Townsend applauded Lighthouse Point Marina, saying Pusser's aligned with \"their vision.\" \"They want Pusser's. Pusser's has such an iconic image in the Chesapeake that they really want that brand,\" Culp said. \"You have a 350-slip marina, why wouldn't you want to have a brand that takes the stress away every day and has fun.\" Last October, Pusser's announced its forthcoming move to Baltimore by shining a spotlight message on the side of its building. Pusser's chose to share the news during its Annapolis Sailboat Show party, when many regulars were at the bar and employees were contemplating their next moves. Townsend hopes his Annapolis regulars will make the trip to Baltimore. Workers were invited to transfer to the new location, so Townsend expects the family atmosphere at Pusser's to live on. \"We knew a lot of our customers on a first-name basis,\" Townsend said. \"The restaurant, it is a little bit farther away, but when you create relationships like we created in Annapolis, those people are still going to come see you.\" With an expiring lease, Pusser's announced in October 2023 that it was outbid for the space at 80 Compromise St. on the ground floor of the Annapolis Waterfront Hotel. The hotel didn't renew the Pusser's lease, instead bringing in Atlas Restaurant Group. Townsend didn't take the negotiations personally. He understood that the hotel had to make a business decision and sign the highest bidder. \"I don't have a problem with Atlas. They've got a lot of money,\" Culp said. \"Whether the restaurant fits what should go in here for the market, I don't know, but they sure as hell are going to make nice restaurants.\" Known for its high-end dining, Atlas will replace Pusser's Annapolis with an upscale Italian chophouse named Marmo and a Mexican cantina called Armada in summer 2025. Atlas will additionally renovate and expand the site's banquet room to welcome 350 guests. Construction is underway. Atlas also owns The Choptank, a waterfront seafood restaurant a few doors down from the old Pusser's. Atlas recently took over the historic Stevens Hardware building, which housed Mission BBQ until it closed in January 2024. Atlas is converting that property into the second location of The Admiral's Cup, a tavern whose flagship bar is in Baltimore's Fells Point neighborhood. Pusser's is known for its Painkillers. The iced cocktail is a mixture of Pusser's Rum, pineapple juice, orange juice and cream of coconut topped with freshly grated nutmeg. The Painkiller originated on Jost Van Dyke in the British Virgin Islands at the Soggy Dollar Bar, which didn't have a dock. Customers had to swim to shore, leaving their cash wet and inspiring the waterfront bar's name. Pusser's was the name of the British Navy's rum distributed from 1655 until 1970. Entrepreneur and global sailor Charles Tobias resurrected Pusser's rum as a commercial brand in 1979, launching distilling in the British Virgin Islands. The original Pusser's on Tortola then adopted the Soggy Dollar's Painkiller recipe and used Pusser's-branded rum. A symbol of the Caribbean, the Painkiller became a celebrated summery drink for sailors worldwide. Pusser's now has locations in the British Virgin Islands, Germany and Florida.

Just before 2:30 p.m. on May 30, police were sent to the store on Loudon Road for a report of a possible robbery. An employee at the store reported a man fled with stolen items and assaulted a co-worker during the incident. The suspect left in a gold sedan, heading east on Sheep Davis Road. The reporting officer searched the area while heading to the scene, but did not find the suspected vehicle. When the reporting officer arrived, they spoke with an asset protection member who accused the thief of concealing merchandise down the front of his pants. He then began walking toward the exit. The protection manager attempted to stop him and then was \u201cforcefully pushed\u201d to the ground by the suspect, a report said. The officer asked the employee to explain exactly how he was pushed and he did. After pushing him, some stolen items were either dropped or fell out of his pants. The recovered items included a butane fuel bottle, a bag of 8-inch zip ties, and black duct tape, all valued at around $14. A description of the suspect was given to the officer. The reporting officer also spoke with another employee who was a witness to the incident. A photo of the suspect and video were submitted to police on June 8 and the officer recognized the suspect as Christopher Plaisted-Comeau, 33, a homeless man now located in Concord. The reporting officer submitted the photo to other personnel who also confirmed it was Plaisted-Comeau, according to an affidavit. The officer attempted to reach Plaisted-Comeau via two numbers the police had on file, but one was disconnected, and the other belonged to a different person who did not know who Plaisted-Comeau was, the report stated. In the video footage, the officer also recognized another man, in his early 40s, who spoke with Plaisted-Comeau at the store, according to the report. The officer spoke with the man on June 22 and asked him about the Walmart incident, but he \u201ccouldn\u2019t remember, at first,\u201d because he visited the store frequently, the report said. The man later confirmed he did give a guy named \u201cChris\u201d rides to the store, but did not know about any incidents. The officer told him he was not in trouble, the report said, and they were just trying to track down the suspect. The man said the last time he saw Plaisted-Comeau was at the Friendly Kitchen a day or two before. The officer noted Plaisted-Comeau had been convicted of misdemeanor theft in January 2009 in Plymouth and felony theft in Coos County Superior Court in December 2021. On June 28, the officer went to the county jail where Plaisted-Comeau was being held, but he refused to speak with the officer, the affidavit said. Staff at the jail said Plaisted-Comeau was currently in restraints due to being uncooperative and other issues. A warrant was issued for Plaisted-Comeau\u2019s arrest and he was charged on July 18 with robbery and theft by unauthorized taking charges, both felonies, as well as willful concealment and simple assault. Editor's note: This post was derived from information supplied by the Concord Police Department and does not indicate a conviction. This link explains the process for requesting the removal of a name from New Hampshire Patch police reports. According to superior court records, Plaisted-Comeau\u2019s criminal history dates back to at least October 2009, when he was accused of witness tampering twice in Plymouth. He pleaded guilty to one felony charge in April 2010 and received a one-to-three-year prison sentence, suspended for three years, but that may be imposed within five years, according to court documents. The second charge was nolle prossed in October 2012. In February, March, and November 2013, hearings were held to motion the imposition of the sentence. In February 2014, the sentence was amended to serve one to three years, stand committed. In November 2012, Plaisted-Comeau was accused of second-degree assault in Plymouth. He pleaded guilty to the charge in March 2013 and received a three-and-a-half-to-seven-year sentence, suspended for 10 years, with three years of probation. Plaisted-Comeau was charged with escape in January 2014 after an incident in Haverhill in October 2013. The charge was nolle prossed in February 2014. He was charged with escape again in Manchester in September 2017 after an incident in March of that year. Plaisted-Comeau pleaded guilty to the charge in November 2017 and was sentenced to a year in prison. In July and August 2021, Plaisted-Comeau was charged with a slew of crimes, including burglary and felon in possession of a dangerous weapon in Albany, aggravated harassment-assault by a prisoner and simple assault by a prisoner in Stewartstown, and theft and receiving stolen property charges in Berlin. In December 2021, he pleaded guilty to the assault charges and the theft charge. Plaisted-Comeau received one two-to-four-year prison sentence, suspended for five years, and two three-to-six-year prison sentences, with 140 days of time served, provided he completed a prison program and had no major disciplinary actions. In January 2022, he pleaded guilty to the burglary charge and received a three-to-six-year prison sentence, with 17 days of time served credit, and a $620 fine suspended for two years along with $45 in restitution. The dangerous weapon charge was nolle prossed. Plaisted-Comeau was also charged with willful concealment in Conway, a felony due to two prior convictions, after an incident in Conway in June 2021. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one and a half to three years in prison, suspended for three years, with $149.64 in restitution to be paid to Walmart, on July 2. Do you have a news tip?

The controversial training at the range on Freeman Avenue comes in the wake of mass deportations of immigrants of various legal status across the United States per the Trump administration's orders. Community members, including elected officials and other organizations, have spoken out regarding the training session, which, according to USAspending.gov, is part of a five-year contract allowing ICE agents to train at the facility. According to the site, the contract began on July 1, 2021, and runs through June 30, 2026, and cites the Department of Homeland Security as the awarding agency and the Town of Islip as the recipient. In addition, the \"current award amount\" is $63,000, with an \"outlayed amount\" of $22,725. Patch reached out to ICE, which was not immediately available for comment. On Friday, Assemblyman Phil Ramos and Councilman Jorge Guadr\u00f3n both issued statements regarding the contact. While Ramos said he was \"deeply disappointed that such a decision was made in a community that proudly holds the highest concentration of Hispanic taxpayers in New York State outside of New York City,\" he also said that he is \"not aware of the full status\" of the agreement, and has requested clarification from the town. Guadr\u00f3n also took to social media, addressing \"increasing rumors\" that the town has allowed the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, to use the range \"as its operations center.\" The councilman said that while the town has allowed ICE to utilize the facility since the early 2000s, it is for \"training purposes only\" and it is \"not where ICE operates.\" Like Ramos, Guadr\u00f3n said he doesn't know the \"full extent or details of this agreement\" and has also \"requested clarifications from the pertinent offices.\" The same day, Islip officials issued a statement, saying: \"An Important Message from Supervisor Carpenter and the Islip Town Board. \"We would like to clarify some misinformation that has been spreading on social media regarding the Town of Islip\u2019s rifle range. It has been the practice since at least the early 2000s, that the Town of Islip has signed agreements to allow the Department of Homeland Security, which Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) falls under, to allow for the use of the town\u2019s rifle range for training, qualification and certification purposes. \"The town\u2019s rifle range is one of the very few such facilities on Long Island and serves a vital role in the training of individuals from law enforcement agencies including but not limited to Nassau County Police, Sheriffs and DA, Fire Island National Seashore, Amtrak, DMV, Suffolk Courts, U.S. Treasury, Farmingdale Police Department and the NYS Park Police. These partnerships help to ensure the safe use of firearms and proper training. \"Those attempting to politicize this matter are unnecessarily causing more distrust of our law enforcement agencies, especially in communities that are already vulnerable and underreporting crimes. The safety and protection of all of our residents, despite race, religion or Country of origin, remains our utmost concern,\" Town of Islip officials wrote. Community empowerment organization Islip Forward, which created an ICE tracker app that documents sightings around Long Island, released a statement, accusing ICE of using the \"taxpayer-funded shooting range\" to \"prepare for raids that tear families apart.\" The statement continued: \"We are calling on the Town of Islip to take immediate action. The town must urgently review every available option to terminate its contract with the Department of Homeland Security and end the use of our publicly funded shooting range for ICE, CBP, and ERO training. \"Furthermore, we demand that town officials issue a clear public statement pledging that this contract will never be renewed or extended under any circumstances.\" Patch reached out to Ramos and the Town of Islip, which were not immediately available for comment.

On Tuesday, previews begin for \"Bonnie and Clyde: The Musical,\" described as \"a bold, high-octane revival of the outlaw legend.\" Directed by Bay Street's Artistic Director Scott Schwartz, the show features a \"a heart-pounding score and a fearless young cast,\" and aims to tell the classic story of young outlaws Bonnie and Clyde with new intensity and vision. \"Set against the backdrop of Depression-era America, 'Bonnie and Clyde' pulses with urgency, romance, and rebellion. Fueled by blues, gospel, and rockabilly rhythms, the musical follows two small-town dreamers on a dangerous path toward fame and infamy,\" a description of the show reads. \"This fresh staging showcases a cast full of youthful talent, whose energy and chemistry bring new life to the legendary story. The production crackles with vitality, charging each scene with a sense of danger, longing, and the thrill of the unknown.\" And to kick off the show's run, on Tuesday, July 29, the musical opens with a special \"Pay What You Can\" preview performance. Tickets for the performance are limited and available on a first-come, first-served basis; guests must go to the box office in person on the day of the show, where they can pay whatever they choose. The show features music by Frank Wildhorn, lyrics by Don Black, and a book by Ivan Menchell. \"'Bonnie and Clyde' fuses rockabilly, blues, gospel, and contemporary musical theater into a high-octane, emotionally charged score,\" a release said. \"The story follows two small-town dreamers whose hunger for something greater leads them down a thrilling and ultimately tragic path.\" \"'Bonnie and Clyde' is a pulse-pounding ride,\" Schwartz said. \"This production features a cast with extraordinary presence and charisma; each performance lights up the stage with intensity, drive, and unforgettable chemistry. It\u2019s a show that grabs you from the first note and doesn\u2019t let go.\" Speaking with Patch, Schwartz said the show brims with excitement. The idea to stage the musical at Bay Street was born when he and Wildhorn were working on another, unrelated project, and Wildhorn said he'd love to see \"Bonnie and Clyde: The Musical\" brought to new life at Bay Street. \"He said, 'I think the intimacy of your space and your ability to do it in this whole new way would be so exciting,'\" Schwartz said. The score, Schwartz said, \"is amazing. I just fell in love with the show. It's so exciting. The central relationship is so passionate and romantic. It's the story of these two young people \u2014 and they were very young, only 19 and 21 when they met \u2014 who became these infamous, world-famous outlaws.\" But then, the pandemic happened, Schwartz said, and time passed. \"This year, it felt like the ideal fit,\" he said. \"We need the excitement; we need the passion. We need to view this energy on stage.\" Schwartz added, of \"Bonnie and Clyde\": \"It's a story about how Americans are on a quest for celebrity \u2014 why we care about celebrity and, frankly, why we can idolize people who break the rules and break the laws. True crime is one of the most popular sources of entertainment, let's face it. And to get to do that on our stage is really exciting.\" Bonnie and Clyde themselves, Schwartz said, \"are kind of like the progenitors of social media celebrity and pop celebrity. If they were around now, they'd be on TikTok.\" Their story resonates, Schwartz said. \"And so, to explore these people who came from absolutely nothing and made themselves into national superstars seemed really, really interesting.\" The show, he said, not only takes audiences on a passionate, wild ride \u2014 a true crime adventure \u2014 but it also portrays the true events that unfolded with gravity. \"Ultimately, Bonnie and Clyde were not only folk heroes, but they did kill people. The show is unflinching in its view of their behavior, and it's complicated. The show will give people a lot to talk about and a lot to think about. I do think it will give them this kind of wild, fun, sexy ride.\" The show follows in Bay Street's tradition of taking a musical \"which has been seen in a bigger way on Broadway and then, stripping it down and doing it in a very intimate, new way,\" Schwartz said. Schwartz has been working with the writers of the show; this adaptation features changes to the script and even a new song that's never been heard before. \"It's really a new version of the show,\" he said. \"Taking the show, and doing it with 10 actors and really making it intimate and intense and so focused on the central relationships \u2014 that's also very different,\" he said. Even the set takes on completely new shape and meaning, Schwartz said. The set is focused on the \"idea of this quest for celebrity,\" he said. \"The whole set is marquee lights. There are more than 400 light bulbs on the set that do all sorts of fabulous tricks,\" he said. \"I think it's going to be quite conceptual and have a quite modern feeling \u2014 but also, be quite dazzling.\" The production also honors the truth of the Bonnie and Clyde story, he said. \"Every major character was a real person. So we want to honor what actually happened \u2014 but we also want to tell the story in a theatrical and exciting way.\" Also, Schwartz said, the musical is not based on the well-known \"Bonnie & Clyde\" film, but instead, on historical research and published histories of the pair. The show is the latest in Bay Street Theater\u02bcs 2025 Mainstage Season, Schwartz said. \"All the shows this season, in some way, have been about love and passion,\" Schwartz said. Beginning with \"Bob & Jean: A Love Story,\" by Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winner Robert Schenkkan, a show that was \"very romantic and sweet,\" to \"DECEIVED\", about a marriage, and a \"woman who's been very much in loved, who finds that he's not at all what she thought \u2014 it's about a love that curdles and deceives\" to the latest production \"Bonnie & Clyde\" \u2014 a piece that portrays the scorching side of love. \"This show is about a love that lights you on fire,\" Schwartz said. \"A love that changes your life. It's also about physical passion and romance. This is the hot side of love. The crazy side of love.\" Schwartz said what also makes the show unique is the fact that the actors cast, Charlie Webb and Lyda Jade Harlan, are actually in their 20s, true to the age of the characters. \"They're astounding,\" he said. \"I think they're going to be superstars.\" And, too, they capture what love feels like, when young people find that fierce passion for the first time. \"There's an impetuousness to their behavior. They don't know any better so they just do what feels right and that's so exciting to watch,\" he said. On Tuesday, guests can pay anything, even a dime, Schwartz said, all with an aim of making theater accessible for all. During the run of the show, there are also affordable seats and other programs to make theater accessible for all, including the opportunity for young people under 30 with an ID, to purchase seats for $30, Schwartz said. Schwartz had a message for audiences, about why the show is a must-see: \"You're going to see a really exciting true-crime story with fabulous songs \u2014 you're going to be humming those songs when you walk out of the theater. And I think you're going to be really, really energized.\" \"Bonnie and Clyde: The Musical\" runs through August 24, with performances Tuesday through Sunday. The Tuesday, July 29 preview performance is part of Bay Street\u2019s Pay What You Can initiative, with in-person box office sales beginning at 11 a.m. the day of the performance.

The update came in the wake of a fatal crash over the weekend. In Monday night's presentation, the police chief said Manassas officials are hearing concerns from residents about crime going up. But Keen says some of those perceptions may involve the Manassas area of Prince William County, not the City of Manassas. Keen asserted that the City of Manassas is a safe community and has a police department responsive to the types of enforcement residents want to see. \"Each of us sometimes have to push back and fight and correct information that may be out there on social media, or things that you and I hear about...crime is going up,\" said Keen.\" It's through the roof in the city and/or events that happen in Prince William County but have a Manassas address that people attribute back to the City of Manassas, and each one of us work every day to get that corrected information out.\" Part I crimes, which are considered more serious crimes, had a mix of increases, decreased and no changes so far in 2025. There were no murders or manslaughters reported in the first halves of 2024 or 2025 within city limits. Aggravated assaults decreased from 18 to five, larcenies declined from 362 to 270, and forcible rapes went from six to zero. Meanwhile, robberies increased from eight to 10, burglaries increased from 19 to 28, and vehicle thefts increased from 51 to 62. The combined Part I crimes resulted in a slight decline in the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024. Keen said the data reflected small numbers, which could result in large percentage changes. \"This, to me, in the police department is good news. But I also want to point out we're only half a year, lots of things can change,\" said Keen. \"As an example, years past, shortly after giving a presentation, we could have a night of a grand larceny of catalytic converters, where they go through and maybe hit 20 cars. That's a big number in one night, grand larceny, that can change numbers very rapidly.\" Vice Mayor Mark Wolfe agreed that the city is safe, noting the decline in Part I crimes. \"We do have a safe community, want to make it safer. That's why we spend all the money and we have an accredited and fully funded police department,\" said Wolfe. The police chief noted that vehicle thefts are trending up around the region. To help prevent car thefts, Keen encourages residents to lock their cars, don't leave keys in the cars and follow the 9 o'clock routine of locking cars and homes and keeping outside lights on. \"Those are all things, little things that we can do in partnership with our community to do crime prevention that helps us with some of these numbers,\" said Keen. The police department also released \"quality of life\" crime data, which includes domestic incidents, overdoses, and mental health calls. Violent domestic reports increased from 123 to 138, while non-violent domestic calls declined from 175 to 146. Domestic violence arrests jumped from 43 to 76. On overdoses, non-fatal incidents increased from nine to 15, while fatal overdoses stayed the same at two each in the first halves of 2024 and 2025. Mental health reports fell from 83 to 29, although reports of mental subjects spiked from 13 to 60. Mental detention orders, which involve paperwork from a court to have a person evaluated at a hospital, declined from 55 to 47. Keen said mental health subject data reflects cases with no commitment order or where a person isn't determined to have a mental health disorder. \"Sergeant [Shauna] Mueller specifically reads every mental health report, makes that connection to both social services and [Community Services Board] so that if we have an individual that is in need, whether that's from addiction or mental health, or in some cases both of those, she helps them get the services they need,\" said Keen. \"So we can get them to a better spot in their life, which, at the end of the day, helps everyone in the City of Manassas.\" According to the police chief's presentation, calls for police service are overall down in the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024. All monthly numbers from January to June decreased, with the exception of January's calls for service increasing from 5,969 to 6,584. Mayor Michelle Davis-Younger said police departments around the U.S. are having challenges with crime but praised Manassas Police for its impact on safety. \"Our numbers, I think, don't look horrible,\" said Davis-Younger. \"Every place is having trouble across the country, so I just appreciate the efforts of all the staff and everyone who works toward making sure that we are definitely safe and people want to be here. So we have First Friday coming, so it always comes with its wonderful challenges, but we know you are all up for it.\" Traffic Safety Concerns While crime data was a mixed bag in the city, crashes and traffic enforcement are trending up. Keen said traffic safety is the \"number one thing I hear about.\" The police department added one new traffic enforcement position in the latest city budget approved by Manassas City Council, with funding from red light camera violation revenue. According to data from the first half of 2025, property damage-only crashes increased from 251 to 448. Crashes with injuries also increased from 99 to 112. Keen noted the latest fatal crash killed a Prince William County resident who was driving out of the city on Saturday. That crash happened in the area of Ashton Avenue between Burnside Road and Godwin Drive. Meanwhile, traffic stops are up from 2,863 to 3,293, and traffic enforcement is up from 1,499 to 1,703. \"As you can clearly see, we heard our community. We've put a little bit of effort in doing more traffic enforcement,\" said Keen. \"That makes those calls for service to go down slightly. But as you can see, it trends the traffic enforcement up, not only the incident \u2014 traffic stops sometimes can lead to warnings \u2014 but also our traffic tickets are up.\" Citations are up from 3,017 in 2024 to 3,269 in 2025. These citations have included failure to obey stop sign, expired registration, failure to obey highway sign, operating a vehicle while holding a phone, driving without a license, speeding 15 to 19 over, speeding 15 to 19 over in a 25 mph zone, speeding 20 or more over, failure to have vehicle inspected, and improper exhaust system. \"I just want to point out they're up, but it is also what our community has asked for,\" said Keen. \"And to be honest with you, we couldn't have enough officers and enough time to do traffic enforcement at the rate that our community has asked for.\" Councilmember Sonia Vasquez Luna shared concerns about the speeding 20 or more over the speed limit becoming a more common citation. \"I will tell you we are concerned,\" said Keen. And you hear this in the news for the region this weekend are reports writing tickets for 73 [mph] in a 35 mile an hour zone,\" said Keen. So we're getting these excessive speeds, and if we're not there doing the traffic enforcement, those are the ones you're getting the phone calls about.\" Along with police enforcement, the city uses automated red light cameras and speed cameras as allowed by state law. The latest red light camera at Liberia Avenue and Richmond Avenue started enforcement on June 1 after a warning period. Keen estimated a 23,000 to 24,000 range of red light camera tickets issued last year. \"We actually do a full analysis before those photo red light cameras are approved, accident rates, distance speeds, traffic counts, all that goes into the analysis before we determine and approve a photo red light enforcement,\" said Keen. Virginia law only allows localities to use speed camera enforcement in active school zones and work zones. Keen said the city does not have work zone speed cameras but utilizes them in school zones. The speed cameras only record violations when the school zone lights are flashing. \"We have a total of four that we move around. There stationed at either Dean [Elementary], Round [Elementary] or Metz [Middle School],\" said Keen. \"As a reminder to the public here and watching, school is getting ready to start. Those photo speed enforcement will be active at the beginning of the school [on Aug. 12].\" Councilmember Ralph Smith highlighted the concern of drivers misunderstanding traffic laws about school buses. \"There seems to be a lot of confusion or simple misunderstanding about the rules regarding stopped school buses even though the light's flashing and the arm is down,\" said Smith. The police chief said Manassas Police will resume public reminders on speed zones and school buses returning, as well as the laws about when to stop for a school bus. Keen noted one state law change may have an impact on crash data going forward. As of July 1, the minimum damage or injury to be classified as a reportable crash doubled from $1,500 to $3,000. \"We all know, in today's atmosphere, a fender bender is going to be $3,000,\" said Keen. \"But it could change these final numbers at the end of the year of what comes back as reportable accidents for the second half of the year, because that change is taking place mid-year.\"", "url": "https://www.patch.com/virginia/manassas/traffic-safety-incidents-top-concern-manassas-police-chief-shares", "sentiment": "Neutral", "sentimentScore": -0.092}, {"symbol": "", "publishedDate": "2025-07-29T17:42:01.056Z", "title": "Activate Opens Active Gaming Arcade In The Avenue At White Marsh", "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/activate-opens-active-gaming-arcade-in-the-avenue-at-20250729.jpg", "site": "https://www.patch.com", "text": "NOTTINGHAM, MD \u2014 An active gaming arcade recently opened its first location in Maryland, mixing the thrill of gaming with the heart-pumping adrenaline of exercise.

Maureen Donohue-Peters, owner of the iconic Donohue's Steak House in New York City, cut the ribbon as she unveiled her newest venture, Donohue's East. Donohue-Peters is a local, who moved to Hampton Bays when she was in the fifth grade and whose roots are deeply entwined in the rich beauty of the East End. And so it seemed fitting that when she decided to open a new location, it would be just miles from the beach where she lifeguarded as a teen and from the homes where she and her closely-knit siblings still live. And from the first moment the first guests stepped onto that iconic porch and into the storied building beloved by locals for decades, many agreed that it felt not like just entering a new restaurant \u2014 but instead, like coming home. Home to a dinner prepared and served lovingly by a warm and welcoming family who exuded joy as they hugged friends old and new. Donohue-Peters, who partnered with her niece Mary Barrie at the new spot, said opening night was exciting. \"You realize how important it is, to have family around,\" she said. \"They ended up working. We're from a family where everyone has always just pitched in. It's nice to see the legacy passed on to the fourth generation \u2014 and to see ownership in the family business passed on, too, to my niece. Mary and I have worked together for 15 years and just to see her come full circle as an owner makes me very proud.\" Of the warmth that emanated with every home-cooked meal brought from the kitchen, or the family members who donned waitressing garb to help out, Donohue-Peters said: \"I view the restaurant as an extension of home.\" The Westhampton community she added, has been very welcoming. \"Everyone has been saying how they've been waiting for so long for a restaurant to come to Westhampton Beach that's just low-key, serving plain, good food. They're excited that we're going to be year-round, too.\" One happy diner told her, \"It's a breath of fresh air,\" Donohue-Peters said. \"The restaurant will become part of the community.\" On opening night, the storied building, gleaming and fresh from its facelift \u2014 but with everything, the bar, the light fixtures, the tables on the porch, all the same and familiar, just as it always was, when the space was the Post Stop for decades \u2014 tables of guests filled the room with laughter and conversation. Their faces were wreathed in smiles as they tucked into heaping plates filled with warm, comforting fare, including Shepherd's pie, meat loaf, turkey dinners, chicken pot pie and steaks \u2014 recipes that have been passed down through generations, Donohue-Peters said. The biggest hits of that night were steak, Shepherd's pie \u2014 and a dizzying number of burgers ordered, she said. \"I would never have imagined the number of burgers I served!\" People are craving the comfort of homemade, nourishing food, recipes from their collective pasts. \"No one has simplicity anymore,\" she said. \"Sometimes when you go out you just want a burger, broiled chicken, turkey \u2014 things that bring back warm memories of days gone by.\" That feeling of warmth enveloped Donohue-Peters when she stepped into the eatery from the very first, she said. \"When I walked into the place first, when I first met Sandy Patterson, the previous owner, I sat down and I thought, 'Oh, my God, I'm home. It feels like home.'\" For Donohue-Peters, the journey is a homecoming in every sense of the word, and her plan is to be at the restaurant day and night, welcoming diners to share meals and memory-making moments. \"I don't care if someone is having a burger and a beer \u2014 or a steak and a martini,\" she said. \"It makes no difference to me how much money someone makes. Just come in, enjoy, and leave saying, 'God, I had a great time at Mary and Mo's.\" To her new clientele, Donohue-Peters said: \"Welcome! To me, it\u2019s a dream. I've come full circle and I\u2019m happy that I\u2019m home. I'm happy I can ease the day for people.\" A strong work ethic is something she and everyone in her loving, extended family share, she said. On a regular day, a customer will find Dononhue-Peters bartending, or preparing for the lunch rush. \"It's so important in this business to make sure you know all the basics of your restaurant, from the kitchen to the dining room to the bar,\" she said. Even on opening night, when things got busy, she immediately donned her waitressing clothes and Barrie, her chef's garb \u2014 Barrie headed right back into the kitchen to join the line as orders came streaming in. And, every family member who jumped in to help, also made sure to stop by tables, to talk to customers. \"There's nothing worse than when you go to a restaurant and the waitress takes your order and then, the next thing you know, a runner plops it down and then, a busser picks it up when you're done,\" Donohue-Peters said. \"There's zero interaction between the staff and the people. You've got to interact \u2014 ask people how their meal was, make it a good time.\" One of the best parts of opening the restaurant is that her extended family, all of whom live in the area, will be helping out, making memories, and passing on the legacy of a deeply-rooted and beloved business to the next generation, she said. \"My siblings are my best friends,\" Donohue-Peters said. \"At the end of the day, family matters. It's ingrained in all of us \u2014 family values.\" Even her tiny great-nieces and nephews are already stating that one day, they, too, will join the family and work at the restaurant, she said. \"It's nice to pass on the legacy.\" And for those who have no family, who are single or widowed and alone in the world, Donohue-Peters has created a haven where they can come for a meal, for conversation, for comfort. A place that's not pretentious, that feels, indeed, like the home so many yearn for, she said. \"You've got to make it home for people that don't have that,\" she said. Donohue, speaking of the rich legacy she's nurtured, reflected, \"As my father used to say, 'If you find something you love, you'll never work a day in your life.'\" Remembering opening night, Donohue-Peters said, \"It was overwhelming, the joy. All the hard work paid off.\" And, of keeping the treasured space intact, she said, \"It's a piece of history for Westhampton Beach, and you want to treat it that way.\" Kristen Collins, Donohue-Peters' niece, also spoke with Patch about her family's enduring legacy. Reflecting on the Upper East Side location of Donohue's, she said, \"I'm prett sure every member of our huge, extended family has worked at or helped out at Donohue's in the city, and I'm sure that will continue here,\" she said. On opening night, Collins said, she'd worn heels \u2014 but, she laughed, as soon as things got busy, she, along with her family, jumped in to help, heels and all. That first night brought so many smiles and a sea of tears, tears of joy, she said. \"Our grandfather would be so proud.\" Collins said she's thrilled that Donohue's East is so close to home, a place where all the family will join hands and hearts and shepherd the legacy forward. \"This is family \u2014 and we want to welcome everyone who comes into our family,\" she said. \"It's such a special thing.\" All the relatives gathered for a family night at the restaurant before the official opening, Donohue-Peters said. As a mom, Collins said she's excited for her son, three years old, to grow up the way she did, eager to go to the restaurant, to \"stop in and say hi to Aunt Mo and Aunt Mary,\" the way she used to stop by the New York City eatery and \"say hi to Grandpa.\" Collins even found a note from third grade, where she'd written, \"If you're ever in the city, stop into Donohue's and say 'hi' to my grandpa.\" Her grandfather, she said, would be so proud of Donohue-Peters and Barrie, both of whom have generous and loving hearts, as well as fierce work ethics, she said. \"They're following in his footsteps; this is what my grandfather and great-grandfather would have wanted,\" she said. Collins also said that the restaurant in New York has long stood as a haven and harbor for souls seeking comraderie; one man was alone and ate there every night for years. When he was sick, the family, who did not offer delivery, brought his dinner to his apartment, she said. That same sense of family will color every memory of Donohue's East, she said. \"This is going to be home for people. It's so special,\" she said. Brian Tymann, a Westhampton Beach village trustee and resident, purchased the storied building from the Post Stop Cafe's longtime owner Sandy Patterson. Speaking with Patch, Tymann said he'd long had a vision of owning the building, which dates back to 1904 and was once, indeed, a post office. \"About five years ago, I approached Sandy Patterson and said, 'Hey, Sandy, when are you planning on retiring? I love this building and I want to buy it.'\" Although Patterson told him she wasn't quite ready, she urged him to stay in touch. Tymann, a frequent customer, was patient. \"She's an absolutely wonderful woman, inside and out. And then, one day she said, 'I'm ready.'\" And so the journey began for the building's next chapter. The space, Tymann said, \"has such a positive energy. I just love being in there, the sunlight.\" When Patterson told him that she'd like to move forward with the sale, Tymann said the process was seamless. \"It was really old school, there were no heavy negotiations,\" he said. Tymann and his three partners purchased the property together; one of those partners, he said, told him he knew someone who'd be the perfect tenant \u2014 Donohue-Peters, who he knew well from her eatery, located on 64th and Lexington. And when Donohue-Peters met Patterson, the two clicked instantly, immediately falling into conversation and discovering similar experiences after decades in the restaurant industry \u2014 a deep and abiding sense of shared values. \"They loved each other instantly,\" Tymann said. \"When Maureen walked in, she said, 'That's the same vintage cash register I have at Donohue's in Manhattan.' Sandy told her, 'I never transitioned to that digital stuff; we take our orders on a notepad.' Then Maureen said, 'We do the same thing.'\" Hearts and mind aligned and a dream took shape. \"It all just came together,\" Tymann said. \"It gives me goosebumps when I tell the story.\" Donohue-Peters has partnered with her niece Barrie, and Barrie also currently manages the New York City location, which just celebrated its 75th anniversary in April. The New York City restauant, which opened in 1950, was born when her grandfather Martin opened a space for each of his sons, Donohue-Peters said. Her father Michael Donohue was the mentor who taught her everything, including how to live a life rich with meaning. \"I came on in 1980 and I worked side by side with my dad every day,\" she said. \"He died in 2000 and I've been there ever since. I promised him I'd take it to 75 years, and I took it to 75 years.\" Her father's words of wisdom have guided Donohue-Peters always, she said, sharing some of his advice: \"Lessons I leaned from dad included, 'Your word is everything,'\" she said. \"Treat someone the way you want to be treated. Remember, never forget the first rung on the ladder because you could always need it again.\" And, her father also told her: \"'You need to be humble. Until you walk in their shoes, Mo, you don't know. So sit back, assess it, talk to them a little bit \u2014 you can make the difference in a person's life.'\" Of her new expansion to the East End, Donohue-Peters said she believes her father has guided her, and that he would be \"100 percent delighted.\" Her father was no stranger to growth; the family had a business in Hampton Bays in the late 70s, she said; over the years, he had a number of restaurants and bars across New York City. Family was everything when she was growing up, and today, the bonds remain strong. Just as her father taught her the business from the ground up, teaching her every role from dishwasher to salad prep, to barback and bus person, and then waitressing, she has now passed on those same lessons to her niece. After she graduated college and expressed interest in joining the business, her father then told her to attend culinary school. \"The biggest part of someone running a business is to know how to run their kitchen. If you have the confidence that you can cook yourself, you will make a winner of yourself,\" she said. Barrie has learned those lessons firsthand, working alongside her aunt and, too, attending culinary school. \"I followed in her footsteps,\" she said. \"My aunt is so passionate about this business and she has such an incredible work ethic.\" Both she and her aunt, she said, work 70-to-80 hour weeks. Their restaurants remain very much a family business; extended family will be seen at the new Westhampton Beach location, Donohue-Peters said. \"You don't see that very often, especially in the fourth generation,\" Barrie said. \"I'm really excited about the Westhampton Beach location, and about keeping the family legacy strong.\" Of the New York spot, Barrie said people love the old-school ambiance, \"the small martini glasses,\" Neil Diamond and Frank Sinatra playing softly. And, Barrie said, she embraces those old school values. \"I'm young but I'm an old soul,\" she said. \"I'm just so happy to build something with my aunt in Westhampton Beach. This business was built by her grandfather and her father and I'm happy to continue those traditions. It's not just like building another restaurant \u2014 it's building another home for our customers.\" And for Donohue-Peters, Donohue's East is a new beginning, a place to sit with a cup of coffee and chat with neighbors and customers, sharing simple joys, days colored with laughter and fun. It's a place to carry on the work she's done since she was old enough to imagine the rest of her life. \"I just love the restaurant business; I can't picture myself doing anything else,\" Donohue-Peters said. \"I can remember going down to the restaurant when I was five years old with my dad, and sitting on the bar counting quarters out of the cigarette machine.\" The best advice for business and life came from her father, her best friend and mentor, Donohue-Peters said. \"Work hard and it will be rewarding. Love what you do and just treat people kindly. Work the magic.\" On the night she opened in Westhampton Beach, her oldest brother Michael sent her a text with a photo of her father. \"He wrote, 'I'll be looking down from heaven, wishing you all hte best at the grand opening of Donohue's East'.\" Donohue's East is located at 144 Main Street in Westhampton Beach and will be open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. for lunch and dinner Tuesday through Sunday, with the bar open until midnight.", "url": "https://www.patch.com/new-york/westhampton-hamptonbays/tears-joy-cheers-donohues-east-opens-former-post-stop-cafe-spot-it", "sentiment": "Positive", "sentimentScore": 0.242}, {"symbol": "", "publishedDate": "2025-07-29T17:42:01.056Z", "title": "Rising Enrollment Could Shift Where Students Attend Schools In Basking Ridge", "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/rising-enrollment-could-shift-where-students-attend-schools-in-20250729.jpg", "site": "https://www.patch.com", "text": "BASKING RIDGE, NJ \u2014 Rising student enrollment in portions of Bernards Township has prompted the Board of Education(BOE) to take precautionary action. On Monday night, the BOE approved the first reading of revised Policy 5120 \u2013 Assignment of Students which will essentially allow the Superintendent to assign incoming new students in the Cedar Hill zone to Oak Street school \"if it was necessary for reasons of schedule, class sizes, balancing the number of sections so that we can provide specials to the students in an efficient manner.\" \"The proposal to the Board tonight is to amend that policy to provide for that possibility should that need arise to manage the sections better,\" said Superintendent Nick Markarian at the BOE meeting. Markarian said he didn't anticipate needing to use this policy for the upcoming September unless there is an unusual enrollment change in the next month. \"But I think it's important to start looking at this policy as we go forward to balance some of the sections in the elementary schools, in particular, Cedar Hill. As we know, Cedar Hill has had an increase in enrollment beyond what the other elementary schools have seen, and it's created some challenges for us in scheduling that we need to have some ways to navigate,\" said Markarian. Board member Keith Molinari noted that this policy change would not impact exisiting currently enrolled students at Cedar Hill or their siblings coming into the school. \"If they are in elementary school, they will stay where they are. And if they already have a sibling at Cedar Hill and live in that zone, they can still go to Cedar Hill. So we are not going to break up any siblings going into elementary school or change any existing schools,\" said Molinari. \"This will just be for new students entering the system if the Superintendent decides to exercise it.\" Board President Jennifer White asked if Cedar Hill zone students assigned to Oak Street would still receive busing, and Markarain confirmed they would. \"I am very happy with this just because my kids are at Cedar Hill and I know it is very close to being over the limit,\" said Board member David Shaw. \"I think this gives us a tool that makes us be proactive here so that if the numbers do go the wrong direction, that there is more kids than we expected, we have a way to alleviate that for them.\" The first reading policy was ultimately unanimously passed by the BOE. A second and final reading is expected at the Aug. 25 meeting. Have a news tip?

The funds will be used to accelerate drilling, complete feasibility studies and provide general working capital across its Estelle Gold and Antimony Project in Alaska. As at June 30, Nova held A$9.08 million in cash and carried no debt. Governance was strengthened with the appointment of Chaim (Dovi) Berger as an independent non-executive director. Berger, a US-based attorney and CPA, brings over a decade of experience in corporate law, finance and mergers and acquisitions. Operationally, Nova has started a 15,000-metre drill campaign across the Estelle Project. This includes 10,000 metres at the RPM deposit to expand and upgrade resources, and test high-grade gold targets along the intrusive-hornfels contact zone. Additional reverse-circulation (RC) drilling will test the RPM North ridgeline and a glacial debris lobe where surface samples returned up to 52.3 grams per tonne (g/t) gold. At the Korbel deposit, 2,000 metres of drilling are underway to evaluate a potential higher-grade starter pit. Surface sampling continues across key areas to generate new drill targets. Drilling began at the Stibium prospect, targeting a maiden resource for both gold and antimony. The area has yielded rock samples with grades up to 141 g/t gold and 60.5% antimony. Read more: Nova Minerals starts drilling at Stibium gold-antimony target In the last week, Nova has intensified its 2025 drilling activities at the RPM deposit, part of the Estelle Gold and Critical Minerals Project in Alaska, by deploying two diamond drill rigs and one reverse circulation (RC) rig operating on a continuous basis. The expanded program is designed to deliver on multiple fronts. Key objectives include expanding and linking the RPM North and RPM Valley zones, evaluating near-surface mineralised material within the valley fill, and initiating a maiden drilling campaign at the Stibium prospect, which is prospective for antimony and gold. Meanwhile, Nova\u2019s DoD grant application remains at an advanced stage, with a positive outcome expected to expand drilling and test new targets such as Styx. Versarien PLC (AIM:VRS, OTC:VRSRF) shares dropped on Tuesday after revealing that an asset sale process failed to find buyers. The company said it now expects that Versarien Graphene Limited will shortly be placed into administration and Cambridge Graphene Limited and 2-DTech Limited will commence the process of voluntary liquidation. Its Korean unit has already ceased operations. Going forward, the group will comprise Versarien Plc, Gnanomat SL and Total Carbide Limited (the latter of which is still for sale). The plan ahead is to focus on hybrid nanomaterials and energy storage technologies.

In addition, mobilisation for the Qala Shallows project has commenced, with key operational and infrastructure works now under way. This includes the re-opening of the mine, the arrival of essential equipment and the execution of major supplier contracts, setting the stage for the project\u2019s transition into active development and ore extraction. During the quarter, West Wits executed definitive agreements for a senior syndicated loan facility of ZAR 875 million (~USD 50 million), representing about 55% of the total funding for the Qala Shallows Gold Project. The loan, provided by the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa (IDC) and Absa Bank Ltd, will be drawn down in milestones, with repayments starting 24 months after the first drawdown and extending over a 36-month period. The facility is hedged through put options, offering downside protection while maintaining full upside exposure to gold prices. With site preparations now under way, Qala Shallows has moved into the active mobilisation phase. The mine was officially re-opened in June 2025, and a three-month mobilisation period is in progress. Key supplier contracts have been finalised, including partnerships with Bara Consulting and Solrock Mining Services JV for engineering and construction, Modi Mining as the appointed mining contractor, and Rham Equipment Specialised Mining Equipment for underground machinery. Critical infrastructure work has already begun, with haulage equipment arriving on site, diesel generators installed and preparations for ore extraction under way. In addition, the first Load Haul Dumper (LHD) has been delivered, and drilling rigs are scheduled for delivery by October 2025. Other ongoing activities include the construction of a box-cut concrete roadway, completion of electrical system designs and preparations for the underground ventilation system. An updated version of the 2023 Definitive Feasibility Study was completed in July 2025, reflecting significantly improved project economics driven by higher gold prices and updated operational costs. Key outcomes from the revised DFS include: Base case - Key production metrics for Qala Shallows. The updated DFS also outlines a peak funding requirement of US$44 million, with an 8-month payback period after the peak funding phase concludes. These figures highlight a strong financial outlook for the Qala Shallows project. West Wits further strengthened its position during the quarter by increasing its stake in the Witwatersrand Basin Project to 74%, following the buyback of a 10% interest from a minority shareholder. The company also completed a A$14 million equity placement, which will fund ongoing operations, the buyback transaction and the updated DFS. Looking forward, West Wits\u2019 next key milestones include delivering the updated mineral resource estimate, securing final project financing and achieving first gold production. The company remains on track to reach steady-state production of 70,000 ounces per year, with a long-term goal of ramping up production to 200,000 ounces annually as part of its \u201cProject 200\u201d long-term growth strategy at the Witwatersrand Basin. West Wits is now entering the decisive execution phase for the Qala Shallows Gold Project, with a clear path towards production and a strengthened financial position to support its continued development. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) has ordered 300,000 additional H20 chipsets from Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, responding to strong demand in China, according to two sources cited by Reuters. The decision follows the Trump administration\u2019s move to allow Nvidia to resume H20 GPU sales to China after a brief ban in April. The H20, designed specifically for the Chinese market under US export restrictions, offers less computing power than Nvidia\u2019s high-end models. The new order adds to an estimated existing stockpile of up to 700,000 units, with around 1 million H20 chips sold in 2024, the Reuters report says.

The proposed 78.5-mile all-weather public and industrial road is scheduled for permitting through 2025\u20132026. Construction of the first 22 miles is expected to start in late 2025 under a parallel project led by the Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities. Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy has requested the road be granted \u201cpriority project\u201d status under Presidential Executive Order 14241 to fast-track permitting as part of the United States' broader strategy to secure mineral supply chains and national energy security. \u201cThe West Susitna Access Road represents a critical step forward for the Mat-Su region, Alaska, and beyond. This transformative infrastructure project is expected to not only unlock significant economic opportunities by facilitating resource development, but also enhance local access and create jobs in the process,\u201d Nova CEO, Christopher Gerteisen said. AIDEA has submitted its application to the US Army Corps of Engineers for the West Susitna Access Road permit. The 78.5-mile route will run west from Alexander Creek to the Whiskey Bravo airstrip, providing vital all-season access for the Estelle Project and surrounding communities. This road is intended to enable substantial cost savings in mining operations, support regional economic development, and improve access to currently isolated public lands. Construction of the initial 22-mile stretch, including a major Susitna River bridge, is scheduled to begin in late 2025 and finish by 2027. The project has garnered strong backing from the Alaskan government, with Governor Dunleavy invoking federal orders to expedite the process. The Governor described the road as \u201cimportant to Alaska, the Nation, and the future of the Nation\u2019s energy dominance and national security.\u201d \u201cWe are proud to support AIDEA and the state's ongoing efforts to build a stronger, more sustainable future through infrastructure development,\u201d Gerteisen said. The state\u2019s commitment to expanding access to Alaska\u2019s vast public lands aligns well with our shared vision for long-term economic growth and national security. We are excited to see the potential positive impact this project could have on both the local community and the state's broader economic landscape.\u201d The access road has attracted support from multiple levels of government and community stakeholders. Matanuska-Susitna Borough Mayor Edna DeVries called it \u201ca strategic investment in our region\u2019s future,\u201d while Representative Kevin McCabe and Senator Mike Shower underscored its potential for economic uplift, national security, and mineral supply chain resilience. Rod Arno of the Alaska Outdoor Council expressed strong support for increased overland access to public lands, and Cindi Hermans, local business owner and president of Friends of West Susitna, said the project was \u201ca long time coming\u201d for the region. The permit application begins a regulatory review involving federal agencies and public consultation. Nova Minerals affirmed its commitment to responsible development and cooperation with stakeholders. The project aligns with Alaska\u2019s constitutional mandate to develop state lands for maximum public benefit, balancing economic access with environmental stewardship. More information on the project, including 3D visualisations, is available on Nova Minerals\u2019 website. https://novaminerals.com.au Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) has ordered 300,000 additional H20 chipsets from Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, responding to strong demand in China, according to two sources cited by Reuters. The decision follows the Trump administration\u2019s move to allow Nvidia to resume H20 GPU sales to China after a brief ban in April. The H20, designed specifically for the Chinese market under US export restrictions, offers less computing power than Nvidia\u2019s high-end models. The new order adds to an estimated existing stockpile of up to 700,000 units, with around 1 million H20 chips sold in 2024, the Reuters report says. Nvidia is seeking new export licences from the US government and has asked Chinese buyers to submit updated order forecasts. Neither Nvidia nor TSMC commented on the new orders.", "url":
