The Fund does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time different than a full calendar quarter. The fund looks to target the duration of the ICE 20+ Year US Treasury Index by investing in Treasury futures in the intermediate portion of the curve using 10-Year US Treasury futures contracts. The fund is designed to provide significant duration from only a modest capital allocation while simultaneously attempting to harvest yield curve efficiencies from the belly of the curve. The fund can be used as a replacement for less efficient long duration holdings, as a means of increasing capital efficiency of intermediate duration portfolio allocations, or as a building block within innovative portfolio solutions such as risk parity.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "Simplify", "expenseRatio": 0.25, "inceptionDate": "2021-09-26", "isin": "US82889N7984", "name": "Simplify Intermediate Term Treasury Futures Strategy ETF", "nav": 12.98, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Cash & Others", "exposure": 50.57113549428863}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 49.42886450571135}], "website": "https://www.simplify.us/etfs/tya-simplify-intermediate-term-treasury-futures-strategy-etf", "holdingsCount": 7}]
