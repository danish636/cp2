The Fund will normally invest at least 80% of its total assets in the securities that comprise the Index. The Index is designed to track the performance of US dollar-denominated taxable municipal debt publicly issued by US states and territories, and their political subdivisions, in the US market. The Fund does not purchase all of the securities in the Index; instead, the Fund utilizes a \"sampling\" methodology to seek to achieve its investment objective. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted monthly. As of 06/30/2025 the Fund had an overall rating of 4 stars out of 165 funds and was rated 3 stars out of 165 funds, 2 stars out of 157 funds and 5 stars out of 115 funds for the 3-, 5- and 10- year periods, respectively. Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. \u00a92025 Morningstar Inc.
