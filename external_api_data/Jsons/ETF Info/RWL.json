The Fund and Index are rebalanced quarterly. As of 06/30/2025 the Fund had an overall rating of 5 stars out of 1088 funds and was rated 4 stars out of 1088 funds, 5 stars out of 1023 funds and 5 stars out of 821 funds for the 3-, 5- and 10- year periods, respectively. Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. \u00a92025 Morningstar Inc.
