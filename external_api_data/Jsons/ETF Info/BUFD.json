The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by providing investors with US large cap equity market exposure while limiting downside risk through a laddered portfolio of twelve FT Vest U.S. Equity Deep Buffer ETFs (\"Underlying ETFs\"). Under normal market conditions the Fund will invest substantially all of its assets in the Underlying ETFs, which seek to provide investors with returns (before fees, expenses and taxes) that match the price return of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (\"SPY\"), up to a predetermined upside cap, while providing a buffer against losses between -5% and -30% (before fees, expenses and taxes) of SPY, over a defined one-year period. Unlike the Underlying ETFs the Fund itself does not pursue a defined outcome strategy. The buffer is only provided by the Underlying ETFs and the Fund itself does not provide any stated buffer against losses. In order to understand the Fund's strategy and risks, it is important to understand the strategies and risks of the Underlying ETFs.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "First Trust", "expenseRatio": 0.95, "inceptionDate": "2021-01-19", "isin": "US33740U7037", "name": "FT Vest Laddered Deep Buffer ETF", "nav": 26.94, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 1.67}, {"industry": "Cash & Others", "exposure": 0.009999999999990905}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 9.81}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 10.68}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 5.49}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 3.01}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 13.61}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 9.32}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 7.76}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 2.04}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 34.21}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 2.39}], "website": "https://www.ftportfolios.com/Retail/Etf/EtfSummary.aspx?Ticker=BUFD", "holdingsCount": 13}]
