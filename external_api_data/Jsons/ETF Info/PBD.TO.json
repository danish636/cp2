Holding derivatives may, when appropriate, be used for both hedging and non-hedging purposes, including: (1) hedging market exposure to protect capital, (2) to generate income, (3) hedging against losses from price changes, and/or (4) as a substitute for direct investment. In addition, by using derivatives, a large portion of the funds foreign currency exposure will be hedged back to the Canadian dollar.
