Securities are selected using a rules-based, multi-factor approach that gauges a companys financial strength. Among the factors it considers includes the companys balance sheet strength, the stability and sustainability of its dividend payout and/or its ability to pay or grow dividends in the future. The funds sub-advisor also considers ESG factors if deemed applicable to the investment decision. Securities are weighted using a modified capitalization weighting methodology designed to reduce the dispersion of weights between larger and smaller capitalization companies.
