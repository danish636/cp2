The Fund does not seek to achieve its stated investment objective over a period of time different than a full calendar quarter. The fund looks to target the duration of the ICE 7-10 Year US Treasury Index by investing in Treasury futures at the short end of the curve. The fund is designed to provide significant duration from only a modest capital allocation while simultaneously attempting to harvest yield curve efficiencies from the short end of the curve using 2-Year US Treasury futures contracts. The fund can be used as a replacement for less efficient intermediate duration holdings, as a means of increasing capital efficiency of shorter duration portfolio allocations, or as a building block within innovative portfolio solutions such as risk parity.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "Simplify", "expenseRatio": 0.25, "inceptionDate": "2022-11-13", "isin": "US82889N6572", "name": "Simplify Short Term Treasury Futures Strategy ETF", "nav": 21.5, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Cash & Others", "exposure": 100}], "website": "https://www.simplify.us/etfs/tua-simplify-short-term-treasury-futures-strategy-etf", "holdingsCount": 7}]
