By hedging out all U.S. dollar currency exposure, HSH aims to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, providing Canadian investors with a more stable and predictable investment return. This ETF is suitable for an investor looking for total return exposure to the large-cap U.S. equity market which is hedged to the Canadian dollar, who can handle the ups and downs of the stock market, but is not looking for regular distributions. HSH seeks to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of the S&P 500 CAD Hedged Index (Total Return), net of expenses. The S&P 500 CAD Hedged Index (Total Return) is designed to measure the performance of the large-cap market segment of the U.S. equity market, hedged to the Canadian dollar.", "domicile": "CA", "etfCompany": "Global X", "expenseRatio": 0.11, "inceptionDate": "2016-09-19", "isin": "CA44055D1033", "name": "Global X S&P 500 CAD Hedged Index Corporate Class ETF", "nav": 78.04, "navCurrency": "CAD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 1.72}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 9.62}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 10.83}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 5.89}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 3}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 13.93}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 9.62}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 7.86}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 2.14}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 32.91}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 2.49}], "website": "https://www.globalx.ca/product/HSH", "holdingsCount": 0}]
