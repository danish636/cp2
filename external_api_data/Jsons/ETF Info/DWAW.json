DWAW seeks to add alpha using Dorsey Wright\u2019s historically successful trend following process and investment modeling that looks to identify the strongest asset classes from the weaker performers. Active Management Advantage \u2013 Many ETFs passively invest owning the majority of the stocks represented in their benchmark index, including those with less than attractive investing attributes. DWAW\u2019s investment process systematically screens a broad variety of asset classes in the FSM All Cap World investment universe for inclusion or removal from its highly tactical, active portfolio. Asset Class Rotation \u2013 Owning or even avoiding certain asset classes \u2013 domestic or foreign, small or large cap, growth or value, factor or market based \u2013 is an important determinant of portfolio success. Asset classes rotate in and out of season. Sometimes those trends last for years, other times for months. By investing in the highest FSM ranked funds, DWAW seeks to capture the growth of those asset classes demonstrating the greatest relative strength while avoiding the weakest. Systematic Defense \u2013 Because we believe avoiding severe losses helps to preserve capital and can contribute to good performance over time, DWAW uses a rules-based approach to tactically add cash or short term fixed income exposure to the portfolio when momentum indicators are triggered. The temporary defensive position is to try to shield the portfolio from certain catastrophic market types.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "AdvisorShares", "expenseRatio": 1.36, "inceptionDate": "2019-12-25", "isin": "US00768Y4796", "name": "AdvisorShares Dorsey Wright FSM All Cap World Equity ETF", "nav": 41.56, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 1.54}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 13.01}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 7.28}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 12.97}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 2.52}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 22.44}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 4.58}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 12.49}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 8.07}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 9.38}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 5.71}], "website": "https://advisorshares.com/etfs/DWAW", "holdingsCount": 4}]
