The Fund will generally invest at least 80% of its total assets in the securities that comprise the Index. The Underlying Index is comprised of U.S. dollar-denominated investment grade corporate bonds which are SEC-registered securities, Section 3(a)(2) securities, or Rule 144A securities under the Securities Act and whose issuers are public companies domiciled in the United States.
