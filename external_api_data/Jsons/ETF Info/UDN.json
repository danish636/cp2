The Fund is designed for investors who want a cost effective and convenient way to track the value of the U.S. dollar relative to a basket of the six major world currencies \u2013 the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc (collectively, the \"Basket Currencies\"). The Index is a rules-based index composed solely of short U.S. Dollar Index futures contracts that trade on the ICE futures exchange (USDX futures contracts). The USDX futures contract is designed to replicate the performance of being short the U.S. dollar against the Basket Currencies.This Fund is not suitable for all investors due to the speculative nature of an investment based upon the Fund's trading which takes place in very volatile markets. Because an investment in futures contracts is volatile, such frequency in the movement in market prices of the underlying futures contracts could cause large losses.
