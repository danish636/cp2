The fund gives access to a portfolio of 40-50 US and foreign companies involved with or derive half of their revenue from the mining, exploration, development, or production of lithium. The investable universe is identified through a proprietary selection methodology which includes industry publication reviews and fundamental research. All eligible securities are then included as constituents provided that the minimum market-cap and liquidity requirements are met. An intensity score is also assigned to each company depending on their revenue percentage attributable to lithium. While the index is market cap-weighted, several capping rules are implemented based on the securities initial weights to ensure a diversified portfolio. Index reconstitution and rebalancing is done on a semi-annual basis in June and December.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": null, "expenseRatio": 0.65, "inceptionDate": "2023-02-02", "isin": "US85208P7096", "name": "Sprott Lithium Miners ETF", "nav": 6.96, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 100}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 0}], "website": "", "holdingsCount": 0}]
