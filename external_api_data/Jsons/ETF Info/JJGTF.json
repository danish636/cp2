The ETNs are riskier than ordinary unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection. The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of or guaranteed by any third party. Any payment to be made on the ETNs, including any payment at maturity or upon redemption, depends on the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. An investment in the ETNs involves significant risks, including possible loss of principal, and may not be suitable for all investors. The Index reflects the returns that are potentially available through an unleveraged investment in the futures contracts on grains commodities. The Index is currently composed of three futures contracts on grains which are included in the Bloomberg Commodity Index Total ReturnSM. Owning the ETNs is not the same as owning interests in the commodities futures contracts comprising the Index or a security directly linked to the performance of the Index. For additional information regarding the risks associated with the ETNs, please see \"Selected Risk Considerations\" below.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "iPath", "expenseRatio": 0.75, "inceptionDate": "2007-10-23", "isin": "US06739H3057", "name": "iPath Bloomberg Grains Subindex Total Return ETN", "nav": 27.1437, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [], "website": "https://ipathetn.cib.barclays/details.app;instrumentId=23349", "holdingsCount": 0}]
