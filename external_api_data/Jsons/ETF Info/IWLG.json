[{"symbol": "IWLG", "assetClass": "Equity", "aum": 123093679, "avgVolume": 9322, "cusip": "45409F769", "description": "IWLG actively invests in US large-cap firms believed to provide an opportunity for achieving superior portfolio returns, also known as growth stocks. Eligible securities initially undergo a qualitative assessment involving an evaluation of their non-financial performance with accordance to certain ESG factors. The adviser then utilizes a bottom-up investment approach in stock selection and targets firms that address market growth opportunities, lead in market share, have competitive advantages, high capital returns, and cash flow growth, and exhibit sound corporate governance. Unlike traditional ETFs, IWLGs non-transparent structure does not disclose its actual holdings daily and instead publishes a proxy portfolio on its website. Actual holdings will be disclosed on a monthly basis with a 30-day lag. In contrast to its sister fund, IWFG, IWLG does not limit its holdings to only the top growth companies and instead targets the broader US large-cap growth equity space.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "NY Life Investments", "expenseRatio": 0.75, "inceptionDate": "2022-06-23", "isin": "US45409F7693", "name": "NYLI Winslow Large Cap Growth ETF", "nav": 52.7002, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 1.09}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 10.45}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 14.89}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 9.51}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 9.86}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 8.21}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 45.99}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 0}], "website": "https://www.newyorklifeinvestments.com/etf/nyli-winslow-large-cap-growth-etf-iwlg", "holdingsCount": 41}]
