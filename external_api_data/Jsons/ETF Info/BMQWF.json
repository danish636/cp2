To be eligible for inclusion, companies should be TSX-listed and must meet investability and liquidity requirements, including a minimum market capitalization of CAD 800 million. The index weights the resulting portfolio equally, instead of by market-cap, which lowers single-name blow-up risk and may cause a tilt to smaller firms.
