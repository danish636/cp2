The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its total assets in the securities of companies that comprise the Index. The Index is compiled, maintained and calculated by Standard & Poor's and consists of the 200 least volatile stocks (over the trailing 12 months) of the S&P Emerging Plus LargeMidCap Index. The Index is computed using the net return, which withholds applicable taxes for non-resident investors. Volatility is a statistical measurement of the magnitude of up and down asset price fluctuations over time. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly. As of 06/30/2025 the Fund had an overall rating of 4 stars out of 711 funds and was rated 3 stars out of 711 funds, 4 stars out of 629 funds and 4 stars out of 453 funds for the 3-, 5- and 10- year periods, respectively. Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. \u00a92025 Morningstar Inc.
