Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in the common stocks that comprise the Index. The Fund, using an indexing investment approach, attempts to replicate, before fees and expenses, the total return performance of the Index, which includes dividends paid by the common stocks in the Index. The Fund will generally employ a full replication strategy, meaning that it will normally invest in all of the securities comprising the Index in proportion to their weightings in the Index. The Index is developed, maintained and sponsored by Bloomberg Index Services Limited (the \"Index Provider\").", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "First Trust", "expenseRatio": 0.6, "inceptionDate": "2023-03-12", "isin": "US33733E8158", "name": "First Trust Bloomberg Inflation Sensitive Equity ETF", "nav": 22.14, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 21.12}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 27.05}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 35.37}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 12.45}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 4.01}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 0}], "website": "https://www.ftportfolios.com/Retail/Etf/EtfSummary.aspx?Ticker=FTIF", "holdingsCount": 51}]
