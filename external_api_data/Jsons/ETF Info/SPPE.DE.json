The index is 100% hedged to EUR on a monthly basis, by selling USD forward at one-month forward rates. The S&P 500 EUR Dynamic Hedged Index includes a mechanism that aims to ensure that the index does not become over-hedged beyond 105%, or under-hedged below 95%, of the parent index currency exposure, whereby if either threshold is breached, an intra-month adjustment to the index is triggered to reset the hedge ratio to 100% after the close of the following business day", "domicile": "IE", "etfCompany": "SPDR", "expenseRatio": 0.05, "inceptionDate": "2018-10-31", "isin": "IE00BYYW2V44", "name": "SPDR S&P 500 EUR Hdg UCITS ETF (Acc)", "nav": 15.67, "navCurrency": "EUR", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 1.67}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 9.79}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 10.53}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 5.48}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 2.98}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 13.65}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 9.34}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 7.76}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 2.04}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 34.37}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 2.39}], "website": "https://www.ssga.com/de/en_gb/intermediary/etfs/spdr-sp-500-eur-hdg-ucits-etf-acc-sppe-gy", "holdingsCount": 503}]
