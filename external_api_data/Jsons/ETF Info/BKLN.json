The Fund will normally invest at least 80% of its total assets in the component securities that comprise the Index. The Index is designed to track the market-weighted performance of the largest institutional leveraged loans based on market weightings, spreads and interest payments. The Fund does not purchase all of the securities in the Index; instead, the Fund utilizes a \"sampling\" methodology to seek to achieve its investment objective. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted bi-annually, in June and December.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "Invesco", "expenseRatio": 0.65, "inceptionDate": "2011-03-02", "isin": "US46138G5080", "name": "Invesco Senior Loan ETF", "nav": 20.96, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Cash & Others", "exposure": 100}], "website": "https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Advisor&ticker=BKLN", "holdingsCount": 174}]
