The underlying index consists primarily of small-caps, but also drifts into midcaps and heavily into micro-caps, overall representing approximately 10% of the total market. Like many levered funds, IWML delivers 2x exposure only for one day. The fund also resets its leverage quarterly. Keep in mind this is an exchange-traded note, as such, investors also assume the credit risk of UBS. Index reconstitution is done annually.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": null, "expenseRatio": 0.9500000000000001, "inceptionDate": "2021-02-09", "isin": "US90278V4041", "name": "ETRACS 2x Leveraged US Size Factor TR ETN", "nav": 19.01, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [], "website": "", "holdingsCount": 0}]
