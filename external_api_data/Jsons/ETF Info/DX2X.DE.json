The Index contains shares of large, medium and small companies, based on the combined value of a company\u2019s readily available shares compared to other companies. A company\u2019s weighting in the Index depends on its relative size but cannot exceed 20% of the Index at each quarterly review. The Index composition is reviewed at least quarterly. The Index is calculated on a total return net basis which means that all dividends and distributions by the companies are reinvested in the shares after tax. To achieve the aim, the Fund will attempt to replicate the Index by buying a substantial number of the shares in the Index in the same proportion as the Index as determined by the Sub-Portfolio Manager of the Fund which is Deutsche Asset Management (UK) Limited.", "domicile": "LU", "etfCompany": "Xtrackers", "expenseRatio": 0.2, "inceptionDate": "2009-01-19", "isin": "LU0328475792", "name": "Xtrackers Stoxx Europe 600 UCITS ETF 1C", "nav": 128.72, "navCurrency": "EUR", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 8.74}, {"industry": "Cash & Others", "exposure": 0.5700000000000074}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 4.18}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 9.71}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 12.02}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 6.42}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 16.54}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 15.47}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 14.1}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 1.55}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 6.6}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 4.1}], "website": "https://etf.dws.com/en/LU0328475792-stoxx-europe-600-ucits-etf-1c", "holdingsCount": 0}]
