DWUS seeks to add alpha using Dorsey Wright\u2019s historically successful trend following process and investment modeling that looks to identify the strongest U.S. large cap equity investments from the weaker performers. Active Management Advantage \u2013 Many ETFs passively invest owning the majority of the stocks represented in their benchmark index, including those with less than attractive investing attributes.

By investing in the highest FSM ranked funds, DWUS seeks to capture the growth of those large cap equity styles demonstrating the strongest relative strength while avoiding the weakest.
