It starts by narrowing down the Scientific Beta Developed Markets ex-USA ex-Canada Universe (reference equity universe) through Carbon Filteringa process of removing the most carbon intensive stocks within each sector in an effort to significantly reduce the weighted average carbon intensity level of the index relative to the cap-weighted reference universe. This also identifies companies that meet the funds pre-determined ESG standards. Remaining securities are then filtered out based on six investment factors: size (selecting midcap stocks only), valuation, momentum, volatility, profitability, and investment. A proprietary diversification-based weighting scheme is then applied to each of the six filtered groups.
