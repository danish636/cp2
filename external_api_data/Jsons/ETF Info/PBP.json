The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its total assets in securities that comprise the Index and will write (sell) call options thereon. The Index is a total return benchmark index that is designed to track the performance of a hypothetical \"buy-write\" strategy on the S&P 500 Index. The Index measures the total rate of return of an S&P 500 covered call strategy. This strategy consists of holding a long position indexed to the S&P 500 Index and selling a succession of covered call options, each with an exercise price at or above the prevailing price level of the S&P 500 Index. Dividends paid on the component stocks underlying the S&P 500 Index and the dollar value of option premiums received from written options are reinvested. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted monthly.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "Invesco", "expenseRatio": 0.29, "inceptionDate": "2007-12-19", "isin": "US46137V3996", "name": "Invesco S&P 500 BuyWrite ETF", "nav": 22.02, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 1.66}, {"industry": "Cash & Others", "exposure": 0.010000000000005116}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 9.79}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 10.54}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 5.49}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 2.97}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 13.66}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 9.33}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 7.75}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 2.04}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 34.37}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 2.39}], "website": "https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Advisor&ticker=PBP", "holdingsCount": 505}]
