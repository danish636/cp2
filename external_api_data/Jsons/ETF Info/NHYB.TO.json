Such issuers can be both companies/corporation or US and Canadian government. Holdings could also include floating-rate notes and loans, preferred shares, ABS and MBS, and convertible bonds. In selecting securities, the fund sub-advisor uses a fundamental, bottom-up investment process to look for issuers believed to have well-defined business vision and competitive advantages. The process is based on sector diversification, companys strength in-depth analysis, competitive position in the sector, management team, market trends and the return offered compared to risk and market conditions. The fund may also invest less than 15% of its assets in other funds, including ETFs, managed by the sub-advisor.", "domicile": "CA", "etfCompany": null, "expenseRatio": 0.69, "inceptionDate": "2020-03-04", "isin": "CA62878A1066", "name": "NBI High Yield Bond ETF", "nav": 21.93, "navCurrency": "CAD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 78.77}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 21.23}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 0}], "website": "", "holdingsCount": 0}]
