The Fund will normally invest at least 80% of its total assets in fixed rate US dollar-denominated preferred securities that comprise the Index. The Index tracks the performance of fixed rate US dollar-denominated preferred securities issued in the US domestic market. (Securities must be rated at least B3, based on an average of three leading ratings agencies: Moody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch) and must have an investment-grade country risk profile (based on an average of Moody\u2019s, S&P and Fitch foreign currency long-term sovereign debt ratings). The Fund does not purchase all of the securities in the Index; instead, the Fund utilizes a \"sampling\" methodology to seek to achieve its investment objective. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted on a monthly basis.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "Invesco", "expenseRatio": 0.5, "inceptionDate": "2008-01-30", "isin": "US46138E5116", "name": "Invesco Preferred ETF", "nav": 11.2, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Cash & Others", "exposure": 99.99624}], "website": "https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Advisor&ticker=PGX", "holdingsCount": 266}]
