The Fund invests in securities of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and dynamically writes covered call options. The call options are written out of the money and selected based on analyzing the option's implied volatility. The option premium provides limited downside protection. The underlying portfolio is rebalanced to maintain better representation of the broad market and of American industry and options are rolled forward upon expiry. In addition, as ZWA may hold other underlying ETFs, the management fees charged are reduced by the management fees paid on the underlying ETFs, thereby not duplicating the management fees.", "domicile": "CA", "etfCompany": "BMO", "expenseRatio": 0.72, "inceptionDate": "2011-10-20", "isin": "CA05573X1033", "name": "BMO Covered Call Dow Jones Industrial Average Hedged to CAD ETF", "nav": 26.54475, "navCurrency": "CAD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 5.22}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 2.28}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 13.78}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 4.95}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 1.99}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 26.17}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 11.96}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 13.53}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 20.12}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 0}], "website": "https://www.bmogam.com/ca-en/products/exchange-traded-fund/bmo-covered-call-dow-jones-industrial-average-hedged-to-cad-etf-zwa/", "holdingsCount": 0}]
