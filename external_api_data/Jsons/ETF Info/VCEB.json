The level or type of involvement in, or amount of revenue earned from, certain activities or business segments that lead to exclusion by the Index provider can vary from one activity or business segment to another. In addition, the Index methodology excludes the bonds of companies that, as determined by the Index provider, do not meet certain standards defined by the Index provider with respect to an ESG controversies assessment or do not have an ESG controversy assessment score. The ESG controversies assessment measures a company\u2019s involvement in major ESG controversies and how well they adhere to international norms and principles. Where MSCI, the Index provider\u2019s data source, has insufficient or no data available to adequately assess a particular issuer relative to the ESG criteria of the Index, bonds of such issuer may be excluded from the Index until such time as they may be determined to be eligible by MSCI. Additionally, the Index excludes bonds of companies that fail to have at least one woman on their board of directors and companies for which the Index provider does not have board diversity data. The screens for ESG criteria described above do not apply to government-issued bonds (e.g., U.S. Treasury securities), asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, and commercial mortgage-backed securities.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "Vanguard", "expenseRatio": 0.12, "inceptionDate": "2020-09-22", "isin": "US9219106914", "name": "Vanguard ESG U.S. Corporate Bond ETF", "nav": 62.92, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 0.512253917235836}, {"industry": "Cash & Others", "exposure": 28.967456809963956}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 9.250703093611863}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 5.644837284049799}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 2.721976697468853}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 28.877059059863303}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 10.777420650863762}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 2.1996785857774137}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 1.6673362796303683}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 9.31096826034549}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 0.0703093611892324}], "website": "https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vceb", "holdingsCount": 268}]
