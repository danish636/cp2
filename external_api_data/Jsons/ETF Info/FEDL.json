The index will use a proprietary methodology to classify the prevailing monetary environment as expansive, restrictive, or indeterminate. The 500 largest NYSE-listed stocks are then scored by several fundamental metrics, based on their potential to benefit from the current environment, where 75 of the best scoring stocks are selected for inclusion. The selected stocks are also weighted using their score with additional factors like liquidity, individual stock, and sector weights. The index is rebalanced when the prevailing monetary environment changes. Note: As a leveraged ETN, DEFL should only be held as a short-term trading tool and carries the credit risk of the issuer.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": null, "expenseRatio": 0.9500000000000001, "inceptionDate": "2021-09-17", "isin": "US90278V7507", "name": "UBS AG, London Branch", "nav": 40.43, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [], "website": "", "holdingsCount": 0}]
