The Fund will normally invest at least 90% of its total assets in securities that comprise the Index as well as American depositary receipts and global depositary receipts based on the securities in the Index. The Index is constructed by evaluating all securities in the FTSE India Index and first excluding securities in the bottom 10% based on their 12-month trailing dividend yield. Of the remaining securities, those ranked in the bottom 10% by their quality scores are also then excluded. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted semi-annually. As of 06/30/2025 the Fund had an overall rating of 4 stars out of 24 funds and was rated 3 stars out of 24 funds, 3 stars out of 21 funds and 4 stars out of 17 funds for the 3-, 5- and 10- year periods, respectively. Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. \u00a92025 Morningstar Inc.
