The portfolio includes investment grade US corporate bonds and Treasuries, TIPS, preferred stocks, high-yield bonds, floating rate debts, foreign corporate debts, and mortgage- and asset-backed securities. The fund has no maturity or minimum credit rating requirement. The highest-yielding securities are selected based on a proprietary analysis focusing on yield relative to price and volatility trend factors. The fund manages risk using a discretionary allocation approach that adapts to changing market prices and volatility trends. During unfavorable markets, the fund shifts exposure to TIPS, money market instruments, investment grade bonds, or floating rate bonds to preserve capital. Otherwise, it stays in junk bonds, preferred equities, or emerging market bonds to maximize income.
