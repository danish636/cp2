The Fund will normally invest at least 90% of its net assets (including investment borrowings) in common stocks and/or depositary receipts that comprise the Index. The Fund, using an indexing investment approach, attempts to replicate, before fees and expenses, the performance of the Index. The Fund's investment advisor seeks a correlation of 0.95 or better (before fees and expenses) between the Fund's performance and the performance of the Index; a figure of 1.00 would represent perfect correlation. The Index is owned, developed, maintained and sponsored by IPOX Schuster LLC (the \"Index Provider\").", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "First Trust", "expenseRatio": 0.7, "inceptionDate": "2018-10-03", "isin": "US33734X7883", "name": "First Trust IPOX Europe Equity Opportunities ETF", "nav": 32.12, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 4.03}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 10.65}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 12.43}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 4.57}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 4.64}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 13.59}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 13.51}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 15.53}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 0.692}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 18.27}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 2.09}], "website": "https://www.ftportfolios.com/Retail/Etf/EtfSummary.aspx?Ticker=FPXE", "holdingsCount": 101}]
