We believe many traditional sources of income are failing to meet investor needs in today\u2019s low yield environment. SVOL aims to provide an attractive income stream and source of diversification while seeking to avoid risks inherent in other income-producing asset classes. The fund\u2019s short VIX position provides investors an optimized exposure for monetizing the premium in the VIX futures market. A modest option overlay budget is then deployed into VIX call options to help protect against adverse moves in VIX.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "Simplify", "expenseRatio": 0.72, "inceptionDate": "2021-05-11", "isin": "US82889N8636", "name": "Simplify Volatility Premium ETF", "nav": 17.3, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 1.71}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 9.61}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 10.46}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 5.48}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 3.05}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 13.79}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 9.68}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 7.9}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 2.1}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 33.84}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 2.38}], "website": "https://www.simplify.us/etfs/svol-simplify-volatility-premium-etf", "holdingsCount": 31}]
