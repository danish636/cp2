In achieving this, the fund implements multiple long/short strategies on a variety of asset classes including equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities. The fund considers multiple technical and fundamental factors in selecting its portfolio of global securities, such as valuation, growth, quantitative, rules-based scoring methodologies, interest rate differentials, price movement, and term structure risk premiums. PMM is diversified at both the asset class and individual security levels in order to manage risk. It also uses technical momentum factors to provide downside risk management.
