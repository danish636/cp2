BMO Canadian Banks Accelerator ETF may also invest in Converge Options that reference the price return of the Reference ETF to employ a \u201ctarget outcome strategy\u201d. Target outcome strategies seek to produce predetermined investment outcomes based upon the performance of the Reference ETF during the applicable Target Outcome Period. The predetermined outcomes sought by BMO Canadian Banks Accelerator ETF, which include the accelerated return (before fees, expenses and taxes) and a predetermined upside cap (before fees, expenses and taxes), are based on the return of the Reference ETF over the Target Outcome Period.
