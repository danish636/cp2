The companies making up the Index are large and medium sized companies based on the combined value of a company\u2019s readily available shares as compared to other companies. A company\u2019s weighting on the Index depends on its relative size. The Index is calculated on a total return net basis which means that all dividends and distributions by the companies are reinvested in the shares after tax. The Index is reviewed and rebalanced at least quarterly. To achieve the aim, the Fund will attempt to replicate the Index by buying all (or, on an exceptional basis, a substantial number of) the shares in the Index in the same proportion as they have in the Index as determined by the Sub-Portfolio Manager of the Fund which is Deutsche Asset Management (UK) Limited.", "domicile": "LU", "etfCompany": "Xtrackers", "expenseRatio": 0.12, "inceptionDate": "2007-01-09", "isin": "LU0274209237", "name": "Xtrackers MSCI Europe UCITS ETF 1C", "nav": 99.42, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 7.46}, {"industry": "Cash & Others", "exposure": 0.3500000000000085}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 4.32}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 10.69}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 12.38}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 6.27}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 17.22}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 15.25}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 13.93}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 1.15}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 6.82}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 4.16}], "website": "https://etf.dws.com/en/LU0274209237-msci-europe-ucits-etf-1c", "holdingsCount": 0}]
