The Fund will normally invest at least 90% of its total assets in dividend-paying common stocks and other securities that comprise the Index. The Index is designed to identify an international group of American Depository Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts and non-U.S. common or ordinary stocks that have qualified as International Dividend Achievers. These companies have increased their aggregate annual regular cash dividend payments consistently for at least each of the last five consecutive years. The Index is computed using the net return, which withholds applicable taxes for non-resident investors. The Fund and the Index are reconstituted annually in March and rebalanced quarterly in March, June, September and December.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "Invesco", "expenseRatio": 0.4, "inceptionDate": "2005-09-14", "isin": "US46137V5488", "name": "Invesco International Dividend Achievers ETF", "nav": 20.83, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 2.92}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 19.2}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 9.86}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 8.91}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 12.06}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 11.64}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 6.47}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 6.6}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 0.38475}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 7.72}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 14.23}], "website": "https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Advisor&ticker=PID", "holdingsCount": 51}]
