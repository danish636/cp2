The Nasdaq Victory US Small Cap 500 Long/Cash Volatility Weighted Index is based on the month-end price of the Nasdaq Victory US Small Cap 500 Volatility Weighted Index (the \u201cReference Index\u201d). The exit and reinvestment methodology of the Long/Cash Index is based on the month-end value of the Reference Index relative to its All-Time Highest Daily Closing Value (\u201cAHDCV\u201d). AHDCV is the highest daily closing price the Reference Index has achieved since its inception date.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "Victory Capital", "expenseRatio": 0.53, "inceptionDate": "2014-07-31", "isin": "US92647N7747", "name": "VictoryShares US Discovery Enhanced Volatility Wtd ETF", "nav": 51.33, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 0}], "website": "https://www.vcm.com/products/victoryshares-etfs/victoryshares-etfs-list/victoryshares-us-discovery-enhanced-volatility-wtd-etf", "holdingsCount": 498}]
