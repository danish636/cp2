The fund utilizes a proprietary multi-layered investment process based on modern portfolio construction technique. To determine its allocation the fund utilizes multiple strategies such as long/short positions in a variety of asset classes, including equity, fixed income, commodities, and currencies, factor risk premia strategies, by ranking groups of securities by their exposure to a factor such as momentum, and alpha processes, by investing in strategies, such as market neutral. A risk-budgeting process is also employed to weigh different components of the portfolios. To measure risk, the fund uses volatility, maximum drawdown experienced through time, tail-risk (a large loss over a short time horizon) as well as both historical and hypothetical stress tests.", "domicile": "CA", "etfCompany": null, "expenseRatio": 4.04, "inceptionDate": "2019-07-16", "isin": "CA72000L1022", "name": "Picton Mahoney Fortified Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund", "nav": 12.59, "navCurrency": "CAD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 10.5}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 3.42}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 7.01}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 5.7}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 9.21}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 22.58}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 4.55}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 13.66}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 4.93}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 13.76}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 4.69}], "website": "", "holdingsCount": 0}]
