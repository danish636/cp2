The Momentum factor is measured by total returns from month T-12 to month T-1, total returns from month T-7 to month T-1, and the intercept from a 1-year regression of stock returns on their regional benchmark. For financials, the Quality factor is measured by return on equity and share issuance. For non-financials the Quality factor is measured by return on equity, gross profitability, change in net operating assets, and leverage. The volatility screen removes the 20% most volatile names within each market cap grouping and equally across sectors.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "Vanguard", "expenseRatio": 0.18, "inceptionDate": "2018-02-13", "isin": "US9219356071", "name": "Vanguard U.S. Multifactor ETF", "nav": 136.32, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 2.88}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 7.59}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 11.53}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 8.55}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 5.43}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 31.55}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 9.65}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 9.66}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 12.7}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 0.47}], "website": "https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vfmf", "holdingsCount": 553}]
