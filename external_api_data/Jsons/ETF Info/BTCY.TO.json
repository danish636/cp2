The fund buys an ETF that holds Bitcoin, primarily Purpose Bitcoin ETF, and actively writes covered call and/or put options against 10-50% of the portfolio. Option contracts may be exchange-trading or over-the-counter. The contracts sold are either at-the-money or out-of-the-money and expected to have 1-3 months to expiration. The amount of the portfolio written against, the type of option writing, and terms are based on the managers assessment of the market and option premiums available. The investment objective of the fund is total return, yield and long-term capital appreciation. The use of options is not to lower volatility. In addition to the investment risks, investors should consider the tax consequences of such as strategy, as transactions may result in reporting ordinary income rather than capital gains. The fund may use other derivatives if a particular share class is hedging currency risk.", "domicile": "CA", "etfCompany": null, "expenseRatio": 1.92, "inceptionDate": "2021-12-03", "isin": "CA74642T1057", "name": "Purpose Bitcoin Yield ETF", "nav": 5.86, "navCurrency": "CAD", "sectorsList": [], "website": "", "holdingsCount": 0}]
