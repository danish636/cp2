Using fundamental factors, companies are further sorted to nine categories: Blockchain, Cloud Computing & Big Data, Cybersecurity, Future Cars, Genomics, Robotics & Automation, Video Gaming, Virtual/Augmented Reality, and 5G. Most categories are equally weighted within the portfolio, with each category having no more than ten companies and equally weighted within their respective category. Companies classified under Cybersecurity and Cloud Computing & Big Data are weighted within their category by market-cap. Should there be less than five eligible companies in a category, the entire category is removed from the index selection process.
