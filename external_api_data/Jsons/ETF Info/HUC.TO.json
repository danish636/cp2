Investing in crude oil-focused companies exposes investors to external factors such as corporate/labour instability, unpredictable governments in oil-producing countries and interest rates, among other factors. By gaining exposure to the Solactive Light Sweet Crude Oil Winter MD Rolling Futures Index ER, HUC offers exposure to the price of crude oil without the accompanying equity risk. HUC is denominated in Canadian dollars, and any gains or losses resulting from its investment in U.S. dollar-denominated assets are hedged back to the Canadian dollar, reducing currency risk for Canadian investors while providing exposure to crude oil futures. HUC seeks investment results, before fees, expenses, distributions, brokerage commissions and other transaction costs, that endeavour to correspond to the performance of the Solactive Light Sweet Crude Oil Winter MD Rolling Futures Index ER. HUC is denominated in Canadian dollars. Any U.S. dollar gains or losses as a result of the ETF\u2019s investment will be hedged back to the Canadian dollar to the best of the ETF\u2019s ability.", "domicile": "CA", "etfCompany": "Global X", "expenseRatio": 1.11, "inceptionDate": "2009-06-24", "isin": "CA44055Q1046", "name": "Global X Crude Oil ETF", "nav": 20.84, "navCurrency": "CAD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Cash & Others", "exposure": 81.63}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 18.37}], "website": "https://www.globalx.ca/product/HUC", "holdingsCount": 0}]
