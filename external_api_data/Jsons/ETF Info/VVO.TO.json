In seeking to achieve the fund&#8217;s investment objective, the manager uses a proprietary quantitative model to evaluate an investment universe comprised of large-, mid- and small-cap stocks from across the world, including emerging markets, and includes a diverse representation of companies, market sectors and industry groups. This investment universe currently consists of equity securities included in the FTSE Global All Cap Index. The manager&#8217;s quantitative model evaluates the securities in the investment universe by reference to characteristics designed to measure their exposure to a variety of factors that drive a security&#8217;s volatility such as industry sector, liquidity, size, value and growth. The model also assesses the interaction between these factors and their impact on the overall volatility of the portfolio. The fund&#8217;s investments will be selected based on the output of this model.", "domicile": "CA", "etfCompany": "Vanguard", "expenseRatio": 0.39, "inceptionDate": "2016-06-14", "isin": "CA92207Q1000", "name": "Vanguard Global Minimum Volatility ETF", "nav": 39.1158, "navCurrency": "CAD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 0.84}, {"industry": "Cash & Others", "exposure": 0.010000000000019327}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 10.61}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 6.49}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 9.85}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 6.58}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 13.77}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 14.35}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 12.7}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 0.34}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 17.75}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 6.71}], "website": "https://www.vanguard.ca/en/product/etf/equity/9828/vanguard-global-minimum-volatility-etf", "holdingsCount": 324}]
