The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by providing investors with US large cap equity market exposure while limiting downside risk through a laddered portfolio of twelve FT Vest U.S. Equity Buffer ETFs (\"Underlying ETFs\"). Under normal market conditions the Fund will invest substantially all of its assets in the Underlying ETFs , which seek to provide investors with returns (before fees, expenses and taxes) that match the price return of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (\"SPY\"), up to a predetermined upside cap, while providing a buffer against the first 10% (before fees, expenses and taxes) of SPY losses. The buffer is only provided by the Underlying ETFs. The Fund itself does not provide any buffer against losses. The Fund simply seeks to provide diversified exposure to all the Underlying ETFs in a single investment. In order to understand the Fund's strategy and risks, it is important to understand the strategies and risks of the Underlying ETFs.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "First Trust", "expenseRatio": 0.95, "inceptionDate": "2020-08-09", "isin": "US33740F7556", "name": "FT Vest Laddered Buffer ETF", "nav": 32.42, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 1.67}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 9.8}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 10.7}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 5.52}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 3.01}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 13.64}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 9.35}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 7.77}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 2.05}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 34.1}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 2.4}], "website": "https://www.ftportfolios.com/Retail/Etf/EtfSummary.aspx?Ticker=BUFR", "holdingsCount": 13}]
