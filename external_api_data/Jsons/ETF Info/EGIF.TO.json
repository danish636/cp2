The funds advisor uses an asset allocation approach to analyze the economy and markets in order to determine which of the above asset classes are more likely to offer risk/return characteristics within a medium to long-term time frame. Asset mix in the portfolio follows target ranges of 30-90% equities, 10-50% fixed income securities and 0-50% money market. Such ranges allow for weighting variety in the fund within the sectors to make it suitable in a varying market environment. In achieving these ranges, EGIF may invest in either individual securities or the portfolio advisor may invest up to 100% of its assets in underlying funds.", "domicile": "CA", "etfCompany": null, "expenseRatio": 1.49, "inceptionDate": "2018-07-23", "isin": "CA30170L1040", "name": "Exemplar Growth and Income Fund", "nav": 21.4, "navCurrency": "CAD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 10.79}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 5.18}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 4.87}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 3.64}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 14.26}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 17.01}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 2.58}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 17}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 7.8}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 10.58}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 6.3}], "website": "", "holdingsCount": 0}]
