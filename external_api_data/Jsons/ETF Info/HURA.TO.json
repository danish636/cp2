Uranium is primarily utilized for nuclear power generation and medical applications, with its price fluctuating based on global demand, making it potentially appealing for long-term investment due to increased nuclear power investment in densely populated emerging economies. In a single trade, HURA delivers efficient access to a globally diversified basket of companies involved in the uranium industry. HURA seeks to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of the Solactive Global Uranium Pure-Play Index, net of expenses.
