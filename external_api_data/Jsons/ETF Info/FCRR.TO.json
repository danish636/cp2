The fund employs a smart beta investment and rules-based proprietary index methodology, to provide investors with exposure to targeted strategic factors. The starting universe is composed of the largest 1,000 US stocks. Stocks are screened further based on their composite factor score based on dividend yield, payout ratio, dividend growth, and correlation to 10-year Treasury yields. Size bias is removed by blending the composite score with a size factor. Securities are selected based on the size-adjusted composite score. Between 60 to 100 stocks are selected, and groups with higher dividend yields are given more weight. Unlike other ETFs in the same family, this fund is sector neutral. The index is rebalanced annually.", "domicile": "CA", "etfCompany": "Fidelity", "expenseRatio": 0.39, "inceptionDate": "2018-09-17", "isin": "CA31644M1086", "name": "Fidelity U.S. Dividend for Rising Rates ETF", "nav": 46.1, "navCurrency": "CAD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 1.58}, {"industry": "Cash & Others", "exposure": 0.009999999999990905}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 9.12}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 10.42}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 5.32}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 2.97}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 12.55}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 9.4}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 8.47}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 4.3}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 33.63}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 2.23}], "website": "https://www.fidelity.ca/en/products/etfs/fcrr/", "holdingsCount": 0}]
