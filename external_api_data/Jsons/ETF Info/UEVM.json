The Index is comprised solely of securities issued by companies in emerging market countries that have higher exposure to value and momentum factors while also maintaining moderate turnover and lower realized volatility than traditional capitalization weighted indexes. The Index ranks each stock based on its value and momentum scores, relative to their sector classification, and creates a composite score for each stock by equally weighting the stock's value and momentum score. The Index then selects the top 25% and weighs them such that securities with lower realized volatility are given higher Index weights. The Index will rebalance quarterly. A liquidity filter is applied to screen out securities with low liquidity by selecting the top 90% based on the highest 12-month annualized traded value. The Index is comprised of equity securities, including American Depositary Receipts (\"ADRs\") and Global Depositary Receipts (\"GDRs\").", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "Victory Capital", "expenseRatio": 0.52, "inceptionDate": "2017-10-23", "isin": "US92647N5436", "name": "VictoryShares Emerging Markets Value Momentum ETF", "nav": 52.88, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 9.9}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 2.84}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 9.4}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 5.03}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 5.81}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 24.88}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 6.7}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 13.83}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 2.6}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 12.45}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 6.56}], "website": "https://www.vcm.com/products/victoryshares-etfs/victoryshares-etfs-list/victoryshares-emerging-markets-value-momentum-etf", "holdingsCount": 205}]
