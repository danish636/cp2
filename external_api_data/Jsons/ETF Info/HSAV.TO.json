HSAV can be purchased or sold anytime throughout the trading day, a key advantage versus other high-interest savings vehicles, which typically have minimum holding periods or investment amounts. HSAV is not expected to make taxable distributions, which could enhance the after-tax performance of HSAV versus other cash savings vehicles, particularly if held in a taxable account. HSAV seeks to generate modest capital growth by investing primarily in high interest deposit accounts with Canadian banks. While any decision to pay dividends or other distributions is within the discretion of the Manager, HSAV is not currently expected to make any regular distributions.", "domicile": "CA", "etfCompany": "Global X", "expenseRatio": 0.2, "inceptionDate": "2020-02-05", "isin": "CA43990D1033", "name": "Global X Cash Maximizer Corporate Class ETF", "nav": 115.51, "navCurrency": "CAD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Cash & Others", "exposure": 100}], "website": "https://www.globalx.ca/product/HSAV", "holdingsCount": 0}]
