Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowing for investment purposes) in equity securities issued by small capitalization companies. The Fund considers small capitalization companies to be those companies with market capitalizations, at the time of investment, within the market capitalization range of the companies comprising the Russell 2000 Growth Index (as of the index's most recent reconstitution). The Fund's portfolio is principally composed of common stocks issued by companies domiciled in the United States and common stocks issued by non-U.S. companies that are principally traded in the United States. The Fund utilizes a multi-manager approach to provide exposure to the small capitalization growth segment of the equity market through the blending of multiple portfolio management teams.", "domicile": "US", "etfCompany": "First Trust", "expenseRatio": 0.95, "inceptionDate": "2021-10-12", "isin": "US33740U7946", "name": "First Trust Multi-Manager Small Cap Opportunities ETF", "nav": 20.98, "navCurrency": "USD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 1.73}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 1.81}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 9.75}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 5.15}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 5.32}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 8.39}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 18.76}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 23.69}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 0}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 25.3}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 0.08975}], "website": "https://www.ftportfolios.com/Retail/Etf/EtfSummary.aspx?Ticker=MMSC", "holdingsCount": 199}]
