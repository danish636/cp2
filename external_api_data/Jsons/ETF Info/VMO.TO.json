In seeking to achieve the fund&#8217;s investment objective, the manager uses a proprietary quantitative model to evaluate an investment universe comprised of large-, mid- and small-cap equity securities from developed markets across the world, which includes a diverse representation of companies, market sectors and industry groups. This investment universe is drawn primarily from equity securities included in the FTSE Developed All Cap Index and the Russell 3000 Index. The manager&#8217;s quantitative model implements a rules-based active approach that aims to assess the factor exposures of securities, favouring equity securities which, when compared to other securities in the investment universe, have relatively strong recent past performance. Past performance will be assessed in terms of both non risk-adjusted and risk adjusted return, over the shorter (approximately 6-months) and intermediate (approximately 12-months) periods prior to the acquisition of the securities by the Fund. This measure has been shown to be a component of long-run stock market returns.", "domicile": "CA", "etfCompany": "Vanguard", "expenseRatio": 0.38, "inceptionDate": "2016-06-14", "isin": "CA92207T1049", "name": "Vanguard Global Momentum Factor ETF", "nav": 70.3576, "navCurrency": "CAD", "sectorsList": [{"industry": "Basic Materials", "exposure": 2.58}, {"industry": "Cash & Others", "exposure": 0.010000000000005116}, {"industry": "Communication Services", "exposure": 10.08}, {"industry": "Consumer Cyclical", "exposure": 9.08}, {"industry": "Consumer Defensive", "exposure": 7.1}, {"industry": "Energy", "exposure": 3.49}, {"industry": "Financial Services", "exposure": 24.11}, {"industry": "Healthcare", "exposure": 10.56}, {"industry": "Industrials", "exposure": 15.67}, {"industry": "Real Estate", "exposure": 0.68}, {"industry": "Technology", "exposure": 16.01}, {"industry": "Utilities", "exposure": 0.63}], "website": "https://www.vanguard.ca/en/product/etf/equity/9835/vanguard-global-momentum-factor-etf", "holdingsCount": 804}]
