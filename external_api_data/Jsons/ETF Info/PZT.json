The Fund generally will invest at least 80% of its total assets in municipal securities that comprise the Index and that also are exempt from the federal alternative minimum tax. The Index is composed of US dollar-denominated, investment grade, tax-exempt debt publicly issued by New York or any US territory, or their political subdivisions, in the US domestic market with a term of at least 15 years remaining to final maturity. The Index is adjusted monthly and its constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding.
