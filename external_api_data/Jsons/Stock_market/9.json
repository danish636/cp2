The funds will be used to accelerate drilling, complete feasibility studies and provide general working capital across its Estelle Gold and Antimony Project in Alaska. As at June 30, Nova held A$9.08 million in cash and carried no debt. Governance was strengthened with the appointment of Chaim (Dovi) Berger as an independent non-executive director. Berger, a US-based attorney and CPA, brings over a decade of experience in corporate law, finance and mergers and acquisitions. Operationally, Nova has started a 15,000-metre drill campaign across the Estelle Project. This includes 10,000 metres at the RPM deposit to expand and upgrade resources, and test high-grade gold targets along the intrusive-hornfels contact zone. Additional reverse-circulation (RC) drilling will test the RPM North ridgeline and a glacial debris lobe where surface samples returned up to 52.3 grams per tonne (g/t) gold. At the Korbel deposit, 2,000 metres of drilling are underway to evaluate a potential higher-grade starter pit. Surface sampling continues across key areas to generate new drill targets. Drilling began at the Stibium prospect, targeting a maiden resource for both gold and antimony. The area has yielded rock samples with grades up to 141 g/t gold and 60.5% antimony. Read more: Nova Minerals starts drilling at Stibium gold-antimony target In the last week, Nova has intensified its 2025 drilling activities at the RPM deposit, part of the Estelle Gold and Critical Minerals Project in Alaska, by deploying two diamond drill rigs and one reverse circulation (RC) rig operating on a continuous basis. The expanded program is designed to deliver on multiple fronts. Key objectives include expanding and linking the RPM North and RPM Valley zones, evaluating near-surface mineralised material within the valley fill, and initiating a maiden drilling campaign at the Stibium prospect, which is prospective for antimony and gold. Meanwhile, Nova\u2019s DoD grant application remains at an advanced stage, with a positive outcome expected to expand drilling and test new targets such as Styx. Versarien PLC (AIM:VRS, OTC:VRSRF) shares dropped on Tuesday after revealing that an asset sale process failed to find buyers. The company said it now expects that Versarien Graphene Limited will shortly be placed into administration and Cambridge Graphene Limited and 2-DTech Limited will commence the process of voluntary liquidation. Its Korean unit has already ceased operations. Going forward, the group will comprise Versarien Plc, Gnanomat SL and Total Carbide Limited (the latter of which is still for sale).

In addition, mobilisation for the Qala Shallows project has commenced, with key operational and infrastructure works now under way. This includes the re-opening of the mine, the arrival of essential equipment and the execution of major supplier contracts, setting the stage for the project\u2019s transition into active development and ore extraction. During the quarter, West Wits executed definitive agreements for a senior syndicated loan facility of ZAR 875 million (~USD 50 million), representing about 55% of the total funding for the Qala Shallows Gold Project. The loan, provided by the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa (IDC) and Absa Bank Ltd, will be drawn down in milestones, with repayments starting 24 months after the first drawdown and extending over a 36-month period. The facility is hedged through put options, offering downside protection while maintaining full upside exposure to gold prices. With site preparations now under way, Qala Shallows has moved into the active mobilisation phase. The mine was officially re-opened in June 2025, and a three-month mobilisation period is in progress. Key supplier contracts have been finalised, including partnerships with Bara Consulting and Solrock Mining Services JV for engineering and construction, Modi Mining as the appointed mining contractor, and Rham Equipment Specialised Mining Equipment for underground machinery. Critical infrastructure work has already begun, with haulage equipment arriving on site, diesel generators installed and preparations for ore extraction under way. In addition, the first Load Haul Dumper (LHD) has been delivered, and drilling rigs are scheduled for delivery by October 2025. Other ongoing activities include the construction of a box-cut concrete roadway, completion of electrical system designs and preparations for the underground ventilation system. An updated version of the 2023 Definitive Feasibility Study was completed in July 2025, reflecting significantly improved project economics driven by higher gold prices and updated operational costs. Key outcomes from the revised DFS include: Base case - Key production metrics for Qala Shallows. The updated DFS also outlines a peak funding requirement of US$44 million, with an 8-month payback period after the peak funding phase concludes. These figures highlight a strong financial outlook for the Qala Shallows project. West Wits further strengthened its position during the quarter by increasing its stake in the Witwatersrand Basin Project to 74%, following the buyback of a 10% interest from a minority shareholder. The company also completed a A$14 million equity placement, which will fund ongoing operations, the buyback transaction and the updated DFS. Looking forward, West Wits\u2019 next key milestones include delivering the updated mineral resource estimate, securing final project financing and achieving first gold production. The company remains on track to reach steady-state production of 70,000 ounces per year, with a long-term goal of ramping up production to 200,000 ounces annually as part of its \u201cProject 200\u201d long-term growth strategy at the Witwatersrand Basin. West Wits is now entering the decisive execution phase for the Qala Shallows Gold Project, with a clear path towards production and a strengthened financial position to support its continued development. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) has ordered 300,000 additional H20 chipsets from Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, responding to strong demand in China, according to two sources cited by Reuters. The decision follows the Trump administration\u2019s move to allow Nvidia to resume H20 GPU sales to China after a brief ban in April. The H20, designed specifically for the Chinese market under US export restrictions, offers less computing power than Nvidia\u2019s high-end models. The new order adds to an estimated existing stockpile of up to 700,000 units, with around 1 million H20 chips sold in 2024, the Reuters report says. Nvidia is seeking new export licences from the US government and has asked Chinese buyers to submit updated order forecasts. Neither Nvidia nor TSMC commented on the new orders.", "url": "https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/1075599/west-wits-mining-highlights-quarterly-funding-moves-as-it-advances-qala-shallows-mobilisation-1075599.html", "sentiment": "Positive", "sentimentScore": 0.248}, {"symbol": "UNH", "publishedDate": "2025-07-29T16:56:47.000Z", "title": "UnitedHealth: Buy This Generational Wealth Compounder While It's On Sale", "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/unitedhealth-buy-this-generational-wealth-compounder-while-its-on-20250729.jpg", "site": "seekingalpha.com", "text": "UnitedHealth's stock decline is overdone; DOJ investigation risk is likely manageable, with historical precedent suggesting a fine and agreement as the worst-case outcome.

The proposed 78.5-mile all-weather public and industrial road is scheduled for permitting through 2025\u20132026. Construction of the first 22 miles is expected to start in late 2025 under a parallel project led by the Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities. Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy has requested the road be granted \u201cpriority project\u201d status under Presidential Executive Order 14241 to fast-track permitting as part of the United States' broader strategy to secure mineral supply chains and national energy security. \u201cThe West Susitna Access Road represents a critical step forward for the Mat-Su region, Alaska, and beyond. This transformative infrastructure project is expected to not only unlock significant economic opportunities by facilitating resource development, but also enhance local access and create jobs in the process,\u201d Nova CEO, Christopher Gerteisen said. AIDEA has submitted its application to the US Army Corps of Engineers for the West Susitna Access Road permit. The 78.5-mile route will run west from Alexander Creek to the Whiskey Bravo airstrip, providing vital all-season access for the Estelle Project and surrounding communities. This road is intended to enable substantial cost savings in mining operations, support regional economic development, and improve access to currently isolated public lands. Construction of the initial 22-mile stretch, including a major Susitna River bridge, is scheduled to begin in late 2025 and finish by 2027. The project has garnered strong backing from the Alaskan government, with Governor Dunleavy invoking federal orders to expedite the process. The Governor described the road as \u201cimportant to Alaska, the Nation, and the future of the Nation\u2019s energy dominance and national security.\u201d \u201cWe are proud to support AIDEA and the state's ongoing efforts to build a stronger, more sustainable future through infrastructure development,\u201d Gerteisen said. The state\u2019s commitment to expanding access to Alaska\u2019s vast public lands aligns well with our shared vision for long-term economic growth and national security. We are excited to see the potential positive impact this project could have on both the local community and the state's broader economic landscape.\u201d The access road has attracted support from multiple levels of government and community stakeholders. Matanuska-Susitna Borough Mayor Edna DeVries called it \u201ca strategic investment in our region\u2019s future,\u201d while Representative Kevin McCabe and Senator Mike Shower underscored its potential for economic uplift, national security, and mineral supply chain resilience. Rod Arno of the Alaska Outdoor Council expressed strong support for increased overland access to public lands, and Cindi Hermans, local business owner and president of Friends of West Susitna, said the project was \u201ca long time coming\u201d for the region. The permit application begins a regulatory review involving federal agencies and public consultation. Nova Minerals affirmed its commitment to responsible development and cooperation with stakeholders. The project aligns with Alaska\u2019s constitutional mandate to develop state lands for maximum public benefit, balancing economic access with environmental stewardship. More information on the project, including 3D visualisations, is available on Nova Minerals\u2019 website. https://novaminerals.com.au Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) has ordered 300,000 additional H20 chipsets from Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, responding to strong demand in China, according to two sources cited by Reuters. The decision follows the Trump administration\u2019s move to allow Nvidia to resume H20 GPU sales to China after a brief ban in April. The H20, designed specifically for the Chinese market under US export restrictions, offers less computing power than Nvidia\u2019s high-end models. The new order adds to an estimated existing stockpile of up to 700,000 units, with around 1 million H20 chips sold in 2024, the Reuters report says. Nvidia is seeking new export licences from the US government and has asked Chinese buyers to submit updated order forecasts. Neither Nvidia nor TSMC commented on the new orders.", "url":
